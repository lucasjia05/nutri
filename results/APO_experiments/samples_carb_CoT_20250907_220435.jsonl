Therefore, 7.9 grams of chives have (4.35 * 7.9 / 100) = 0.34365g of carbs.\n\n2. **Peanut paste**: 100 grams of peanut paste have approximately 22g of carbs. Therefore, 7.6 grams of peanut paste have (22 * 7.6 / 100) = 1.672g of carbs.\n\n3. **Boiled okra**: 100 grams of boiled okra have approximately 7.45g of carbs. Therefore, 37.9 grams of boiled okra have (7.45 * 37.9 / 100) = 2.82455g of carbs.\n\n4. **Red palm oil**: Red palm oil does not contain carbohydrates, so it contributes 0g of carbs.\n\n5. **Hard maize grain porridge**: 100 grams of maize porridge have approximately 21g of carbs. Therefore, 427 grams of maize porridge have (21 * 427 / 100) = 89.67g of carbs.\n\n6. **Salt**: Salt does not contain carbohydrates, so it contributes 0g of carbs.\n\n7. **Other Solanaceae**: Without specific information on the type of Solanaceae, we cannot accurately determine the carbohydrate content. However, assuming a generic Solanaceae like tomatoes, 100 grams of tomatoes have approximately 3.9g of carbs. Therefore, 47.3 grams of tomatoes have (3.9 * 47.3 / 100) = 1.8447g of carbs.\n\n8. **Beef stock granules**: 100 grams of beef stock granules have approximately 20g of carbs. Therefore, 0.3 grams of beef stock granules have (20 * 0.3 / 100) = 0.06g of carbs.\n\nNow, summing up the carbohydrates from all items:\nTotal carbs = 0.34365 + 1.672 + 2.82455 + 0 + 89.67 + 0 + 1.8447 + 0.06 = 96.4149\n\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 96.4149}"], "pred": 96.4149, "threshold": 7.5, "percent": false, "result": {"acc": false, "mae": 30.7851, "mse": 947.72238201, "answer_rate": true}}

1. 100g of boiled white navy beans has approximately 21.1g of carbs. Therefore, 48g has (21.1 * 48/100) = 10.128g of carbs.
2. 100g of boiled kidney beans has approximately 20.2g of carbs. Therefore, 16g has (20.2 * 16/100) = 3.232g of carbs.
3. 100g of boiled groundnut powder has approximately 21.5g of carbs. Therefore, 16g has (21.5 * 16/100) = 3.44g of carbs.
4. 100g of boiled white maize flour has approximately 21.5g of carbs. Therefore, 115g has (21.5 * 115/100) = 24.725g of carbs.
5. 100g of boiled large onion has approximately 7.64g of carbs. Therefore, 13g has (7.64 * 13/100) = 0.9932g of carbs.
6. 100g of boiled sweet potato leaves has approximately 8.2g of carbs. Therefore, 26g has (8.2 * 26/100) = 2.132g of carbs.
7. 100g of boiled ripe tomato has approximately 3.9g of carbs. Therefore, 45g has (3.9 * 45/100) = 1.755g of carbs.

Total carbohydrates = 10.128 + 3.232 + 3.44 + 24.725 + 0.9932 + 2.132 + 1.755 = 46.4052

1. For the large frozen meal:
   - Fried chicken, potatoes, and vegetables can vary significantly in carbohydrate content. Without specific breakdowns, it's challenging to provide an exact carbohydrate count. However, a rough estimate for a mixed meal like this could be around 30-40g of carbs per 100g, depending on the proportion of potatoes and vegetables.
   - Assuming an average of 35g of carbs per 100g, for 468.0g, the carbs would be approximately (35 * 4.68) = 163.8g of carbs.

2. For the 372.0g soft drink cola:
   - Soft drinks typically have about 10.6g of carbs per 100g.

1. For country soup:
   - The carbohydrate content can vary significantly depending on the ingredients. However, a general estimate for a vegetable-based country soup is about 5g of carbohydrates per 100g.
   - Therefore, 436.1 grams of country soup would have approximately (5 * 436.1 / 100) = 21.805g of carbohydrates.

2. For plum dumplings:
   - Plum dumplings typically have about 30g of carbohydrates per 100g.

Now, let's calculate the carbohydrates for each item:

1. Dried apricot halves (sulfured): 100g has approximately 63g of carbs. So, 10.5g has (63 * 10.5 / 100) = 6.615g of carbs.
2. Instant dry oatmeal: 100g has approximately 68g of carbs. So, 16.88g has (68 * 16.88 / 100) = 11.4784g of carbs.
3. Kellogg's Corn Flakes cereal: 100g has approximately 84g of carbs. So, 70g has (84 * 70 / 100) = 58.8g of carbs.
4. Low-fat pasteurized milk: 100g has approximately 5g of carbs. So, 200g has (5 * 200 / 100) = 10g of carbs.
5. Nestum cereal prepared with water: 100g has approximately 80g of carbs. So, 61.25g has (80 * 61.25 / 100) = 49g of carbs.
6. Orange: 100g has approximately 12g of carbs. So, 38.7g has (12 * 38.7 / 100) = 4.644g of carbs.
7. Raisins: 100g has approximately 79g of carbs. So, 4.92g has (79 * 4.92 / 100) = 3.8868g of carbs.

1. 100g of boiled white navy beans has approximately 21.1g of carbs. Therefore, 48g has (21.1 * 48/100) = 10.128g of carbs.
2. 100g of boiled kidney beans has approximately 20.2g of carbs. Therefore, 16g has (20.2 * 16/100) = 3.232g of carbs.
3. 100g of boiled groundnut powder has approximately 21.5g of carbs. Therefore, 16g has (21.5 * 16/100) = 3.44g of carbs.
4. 100g of boiled white maize flour has approximately 21.5g of carbs. Therefore, 115g has (21.5 * 115/100) = 24.725g of carbs.
5. 100g of boiled large onion has approximately 7.64g of carbs. Therefore, 13g has (7.64 * 13/100) = 0.9932g of carbs.
6. 100g of boiled sweet potato leaves has approximately 8.2g of carbs. Therefore, 26g has (8.2 * 26/100) = 2.132g of carbs.
7. 100g of boiled ripe tomato has approximately 3.9g of carbs. Therefore, 45g has (3.9 * 45/100) = 1.755g of carbs.

Total carbohydrates = 10.128 + 3.232 + 3.44 + 24.725 + 0.9932 + 2.132 + 1.755 = 46.4052

1. For the large frozen meal:
   - Fried chicken, potatoes, and vegetables can vary significantly in carbohydrate content. Without specific breakdowns, it's challenging to provide an exact carbohydrate count. However, a rough estimate for a mixed meal like this could be around 30-40g of carbs per 100g, depending on the proportion of potatoes and vegetables.
   - Assuming an average of 35g of carbs per 100g, for 468.0g, the carbs would be approximately (35 * 4.68) = 163.8g of carbs.

2. For the 372.0g soft drink cola:
   - Soft drinks typically have about 10.6g of carbs per 100g.

1. For country soup:
   - The carbohydrate content can vary significantly depending on the ingredients. However, a general estimate for a vegetable-based country soup is about 5g of carbohydrates per 100g.
   - Therefore, 436.1 grams of country soup would have approximately (5 * 436.1 / 100) = 21.805g of carbohydrates.

2. For plum dumplings:
   - Plum dumplings typically have about 30g of carbohydrates per 100g.

Wheat flour typically contains about 72g of carbohydrates per 100g. Assuming Kurkuto is primarily made of wheat flour, 98g of Kurkuto would have approximately (72 * 0.98) = 70.56g of carbohydrates.

Now, let's calculate the carbohydrates for each item:

1. Dried apricot halves (sulfured): 100g has approximately 63g of carbs. So, 10.5g has (63 * 10.5 / 100) = 6.615g of carbs.
2. Instant dry oatmeal: 100g has approximately 68g of carbs. So, 16.88g has (68 * 16.88 / 100) = 11.4784g of carbs.
3. Kellogg's Corn Flakes cereal: 100g has approximately 84g of carbs. So, 70g has (84 * 70 / 100) = 58.8g of carbs.
4. Low-fat pasteurized milk: 100g has approximately 5g of carbs. So, 200g has (5 * 200 / 100) = 10g of carbs.
5. Nestum cereal prepared with water: 100g has approximately 80g of carbs. So, 61.25g has (80 * 61.25 / 100) = 49g of carbs.
6. Orange: 100g has approximately 12g of carbs. So, 38.7g has (12 * 38.7 / 100) = 4.644g of carbs.
7. Raisins: 100g has approximately 79g of carbs. So, 4.92g has (79 * 4.92 / 100) = 3.8868g of carbs.

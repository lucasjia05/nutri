2. A Tunisian brick's carbohydrate content can vary significantly based on the specific ingredients and preparation method. Without specific nutritional information, it's challenging to provide an accurate carbohydrate count. Therefore, we will assume the carbohydrate content is unknown.

So the total grams of carbs in the meal, excluding the unknown salad, = (0 + 0.55 + 41.7735) = 42.3235

Since we don't have the carbohydrate content for the spicy Bon salad, we cannot provide a complete total. Therefore, we set the value of ""total_carbohydrates"" to -1.

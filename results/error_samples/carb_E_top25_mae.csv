The cream sauce may have some carbohydrates, but it is primarily fat-based. Poultry is primarily protein and fat, and non-starchy veggies are low in carbohydrates.\n\nGiven the total energy of 475 kcal, the majority of the carbohydrates are likely coming from the pasta. The cream sauce, poultry, and veggies are not expected to significantly increase the carbohydrate content beyond the pasta itself.\n\nTherefore, the total carbohydrates for the meal are approximately 75g.\n\nOutput: {""total_carbohydrates"": 75}']",36.92,75.0,"['{{""total_carbohydrates"": 75}}']",36.92

A red apple (120g) has approximately 14g of carbohydrates per 100g. So, 120g of apple has (14 * 1.2) = 16.8g of carbohydrates.\n\n2. Cooked rice has about 28g of carbohydrates per 100g. So, 280g of cooked rice has (28 * 2.8) = 78.4g of carbohydrates.\n\n3. Small cuttlefish fried with chili paste: Cuttlefish itself is low in carbohydrates, and chili paste typically adds minimal carbohydrates. For this calculation, we will assume the carbohydrates are negligible.\n\n4. String beans stir-fried with anchovies: String beans have about 7g of carbohydrates per 100g. So, 190.34g of string beans has (7 * 1.9034) = 13.3238g of carbohydrates. Anchovies add negligible carbohydrates.\n\nAdding up the carbohydrates:\n16.8g (apple) + 78.4g (rice) + 0g (cuttlefish) + 13.3238g (string beans) = 108.5238g\n\nOutput: {""total_carbohydrates"": 108.5238}']",5.4361999999999995,130.5,"['{{""total_carbohydrates"": 130.5}}']",16.540000000000006

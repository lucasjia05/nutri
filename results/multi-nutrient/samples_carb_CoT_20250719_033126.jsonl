Boiled fresh baobab leaves: 100 grams contain approximately 10 grams of carbohydrates. So, for 21 grams, it contains (10 * 21/100) = 2.1 grams of carbohydrates.\n2. Boiled dried fish powder: Fish generally has no carbohydrates.\n3. Flavor enhancer: Typically negligible carbohydrates for such a small amount.\n4. Salt: Contains no carbohydrates.\n5. Liquid potassium salt: Contains no carbohydrates.\n6. White sorghum flour (fermented and boiled): 100 grams contain approximately 72 grams of carbohydrates. So, for 175 grams, it contains (72 * 175/100) = 126 grams of carbohydrates.\n7. Dry stink beans (fermented and boiled): 100 grams contain approximately 15 grams of carbohydrates.

The meal consists of:\n- Scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs\n- 1 toast\n2. No energy provided.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs. 1 toast has 13g carbs.\n4. Add carbohydrate values.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 106.6 kcal. I've got a drink made from 248 grams of oatmeal and water for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. The meal consists of:\n- A drink made from 248g of oatmeal and water\n2. Estimate energy contributions per item.\n248g of oatmeal: Approx. 70 kcal / 100g\n248g * 0.7 kcal / g =  173.6 kcal. This is far above 106.6 kcal, so something is off.\nReconsider oatmeal: 248g may be referring to the entire drink, rather than the amount of dry oatmeal.\n248g of oatmeal drink: Approx. 45 kcal / 100g\n248 * 0.45 kcal / g = 111.6 kcal - acceptable.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nAn oatmeal drink typically has around 10.5g carbs per 100g:\n248g * 0.105 = 26.04g carbs\n4. Add the carbs from all items and return the total as a dictionary.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 1470 kcal. For breakfast, I had 61.9g of red palm oil and 729.0g of ready-to-eat maize porridge.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- 61.9g of red palm oil\n- 729g of ready-to-eat maize porridge\n2. Estimate energy contributions per item.\nRed palm oil: Energy content is about 884 kcal per 100g.\nFor 61.9g: 884 * 0.619 = 547 kcal\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: This depends heavily on its water content. A typical maize porridge (thin) has ~50-60 kcal per 100g.\n729g * 0.55 = 400.95 kcal.\nTotal estimated: 547 + 401 = 948 kcal. This is far below the stated 1470 kcal.\nAdjustment needed: Either the maize porridge is more concentrated or oil quantity/energy is wrong.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 160 kcal/100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\nTry 729 * 1.27 = 926.8 kcal. (127 kcal/100g assumption)\nNew total: 547 (oil) + 927 (porridge) \u2248 1474 kcal, matching well. So, we assume maize porridge at 127 kcal/100g.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nRed palm oil: 0g carbs (pure fat)\nMaize porridge: At 127 kcal/100g, and assuming 80% of energy is from carbs:\n127 kcal * 0.90 = 114.3 kcal from carbs\nSo 114.3 / 4 = 28.6g carbs per 100g\nUsing 28.6g/100g as a realistic estimate:\n729g * 0.286 = 208.5g carbs\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 208.5}", "query": "The following meal contains 926.1600000000001 kcal.

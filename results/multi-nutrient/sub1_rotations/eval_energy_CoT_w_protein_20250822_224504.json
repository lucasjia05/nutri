    "prompt": "For the given query including a meal description, think step by step as follows:\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size. If no size is given, assume one standard serving based on common guidelines. Use USDA references for meals typically associated with Western/U.S. diets. For other regional or traditional meals, prefer FAO/WHO food composition data.\n2. If total protein (in grams) is provided, estimate the amount of protein each item contributes to the total. If the total protein estimated differs by more than 20%, reconsider the assumed form of every single relevant item (e.g. concentration, dry vs wet vs dehydrated). Repeat this step until a consistent protein estimate is obtained.\n3. For each item settled on, estimate its energy content in kcal.\n4. Add the energy values from all items. Respond with a dictionary object containing the total energy in kcal as follows:\n{\"total_energy\": total energy in kcal for the meal}\nFor the total energy, respond with just the numeric amount of energy without extra text. If you don't know the answer, set the value of \"total_energy\" to -1.\n\nFollow the format of the following examples when answering:\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- Scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs\n- 1 toast\n2. No protein provided.\n3. Estimate energy content in kcal.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 204 kcal.\n1 toast has 73.2 kcal.\n4. Add energy values.\nThe total kilocalories in the meal = (204 + 73.2) = 277.2\nOutput: {\"total_energy\": 277.2}\n\nQuery: \"Half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The meal contained 6 grams of protein.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- Half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich\n2. Estimate protein contributions per item.\n1 peanut butter and jelly sandwich has 12.8g protein so half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich has (12.8*(1/2)) = 6.4g protein.\nMatches the provided total (no need to adjust assumptions).\n3. Estimate energy content in kcal.\n1 peanut butter and jelly sandwich has 404 kcal so half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich has (404*(1/2)) = 202 kcal.\n4. Add energy values.\nOutput: {\"total_energy\": 202}\n\nQuery: \"For breakfast, I had 61.9g of red palm oil and 729.0g of ready-to-eat maize porridge. The meal contained 20g protein.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- 61.9g of red palm oil\n- 729g of ready-to-eat maize porridge\n2. Estimate protein contributions per item.\nRed palm oil: ~0g protein.\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: This depends heavily on its water content. A typical maize porridge (thin) has 2g protein per 100g.\n729g * 0.02 = 14.6g protein.\nTotal estimated: 0 + 14.6 = 14.6g protein. This is more than 20% below the stated 20g protein.\nAdjustment needed: The porridge is likely more concentrated.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 2.8g protein per 100g (closer to stiff ugali consistency).\n729 * 0.028 = 20.4g protein, which matches the provided 20g context.\nSo we assume a denser porridge at 2.8g protein/100g.\n3. Estimate energy content in kcal.\nRed palm oil: Energy content is about 884 kcal per 100g.\nFor 61.9g: 61.9 * 8.84 = 547 kcal\nThick maize porridge: Based on FAO data for stiff maize porridge (e.g. ugali or sadza), energy content is typically 127 kcal/100g.\nFor 729g: 729 * 1.27 kcal = 926 kcal\n4. Add energy values and respond with total.\nTotal: 547 (oil) + 926 (porridge) \u2248 1473 kcal\nOutput: {\"total_energy\": 1473}",

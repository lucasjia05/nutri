Boiled fresh baobab leaves: These are primarily a source of fiber and have minimal carbohydrates. For 21 grams, the carbohydrate content is negligible.\n\n2. Boiled dried fish powder: Fish is primarily protein and fat, with negligible carbohydrates. For 14 grams, the carbohydrate content is negligible.\n\n3. Flavor enhancer: Typically, flavor enhancers like MSG have negligible carbohydrates. For 2 grams, the carbohydrate content is negligible.\n\n4. Salt: Salt contains no carbohydrates. For 2 grams, the carbohydrate content is 0g.\n\n5. Liquid potassium salt: This is a mineral salt substitute and contains no carbohydrates. For 8 grams, the carbohydrate content is 0g.\n\n6. White sorghum flour (fermented and boiled): Sorghum flour is a significant source of carbohydrates. 100 grams of sorghum flour typically contains about 75g of carbohydrates.

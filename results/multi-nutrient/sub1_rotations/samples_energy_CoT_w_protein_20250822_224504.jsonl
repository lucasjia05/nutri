Assuming a typical lean beef cut, it has about 26g of protein per 100g.\n  For 162g of beef and veggies, let's assume 100g is beef and 62g is veggies.\n  Protein from beef: 100g * 0.26 = 26g protein.\n  Veggies (carrots and broccoli) contribute negligible protein.\n- Cooked rice: Typically has about 2.7g of protein per 100g.\n  For 158g: 158 * 0.027 = 4.3g protein.\n\nTotal estimated protein: 26 (beef) + 4.3 (rice) = 30.3g protein.\nThis is more than 20% above the stated 22.7g protein, suggesting the beef portion might be smaller or less concentrated in protein.\n\nAdjustment: Let's assume a smaller portion of beef, say 80g beef and 82g veggies.\n- Protein from beef: 80g * 0.26 = 20.8g protein.\n- Total protein: 20.8 (beef) + 4.3 (rice) = 25.1g protein.\nThis is still slightly above but closer to the stated 22.7g protein.\n\n3. Estimate energy content in kcal.\n- Beef: Assuming 80g of beef, energy content is about 250 kcal per 100g.\n  For 80g: 80 * 2.5 = 200 kcal.\n- Veggies: Carrots and broccoli are low in calories, approximately 35 kcal per 100g.\n  For 82g: 82 * 0.35 = 28.7 kcal.\n- Cooked rice: Energy content is about 130 kcal per 100g.\n  For 158g: 158 * 1.3 = 205.4 kcal.\n\n4.

Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 2.8g protein per 100g (closer to stiff ugali consistency).\n729 * 0.028 = 20.4g protein, which matches the provided 20g context.\nSo we assume a denser porridge at 2.8g protein/100g.\n3. Estimate energy content in kcal.\nRed palm oil: Energy content is about 884 kcal per 100g.\nFor 61.9g: 61.9 * 8.84 = 547 kcal\nThick maize porridge: Based on FAO data for stiff maize porridge (e.g. ugali or sadza), energy content is typically 127 kcal/100g.\nFor 729g: 729 * 1.27 kcal = 926 kcal\n4.

For 15g, this would be 15 * 0.08 = 1.2g protein.\n- Cooked white rice: Cooked white rice has about 2.7g of protein per 100g. For 300g, this would be 300 * 0.027 = 8.1g protein.\n\nTotal estimated protein: 8.1 (dhal) + 1.2 (leaves) + 8.1 (rice) = 17.4g protein. This is more than 20% above the stated 12.51g protein.\n\nAdjustment needed: The dhal curry might have less protein due to dilution or additional ingredients.

This is still slightly above the stated 12.51g but within a reasonable range considering potential variations in preparation.\n\n3. Estimate energy content in kcal.\n- Dhal curry: Assuming 5g protein per 100g, energy content is about 120 kcal per 100g. For 90g: 90 * 1.2 = 108 kcal.\n- Hummingbird tree leaves: Energy content is about 64 kcal per 100g. For 15g: 15 * 0.64 = 9.6 kcal.\n- Cooked white rice: Energy content is about 130 kcal per 100g. For 300g: 300 * 1.3 = 390 kcal.\n\n4.

For 89.3g, this is approximately 2.23g protein.\n- Olive oil: ~0g protein.\n- Pickled olives: Minimal protein, approximately 0.1g per 15g.\n- Baguette bread: Typically has about 8g protein per 100g. For 50g, this is approximately 4g protein.\n\nTotal estimated protein: 2.23 (soup) + 0 (olive oil) + 0.1 (olives) + 4 (bread) = 6.33g protein. This is more than 20% below the stated 10.09g protein.\n\nAdjustment needed: The soup likely has more chicken or a higher protein content than initially assumed. Let's assume a higher protein content for the soup, around 5g protein per 100g.\n- For 89.3g of soup: 89.3 * 0.05 = 4.47g protein.\n\nRevised total protein: 4.47 (soup) + 0 (olive oil) + 0.1 (olives) + 4 (bread) = 8.57g protein. This is still below the stated 10.09g protein.\n\nFurther adjustment: Assume the soup has even more chicken or a denser protein content, around 6.3g protein per 100g.\n- For 89.3g of soup: 89.3 * 0.063 = 5.63g protein.\n\nRevised total protein: 5.63 (soup) + 0 (olive oil) + 0.1 (olives) + 4 (bread) = 9.73g protein. This is close enough to the stated 10.09g protein.\n\n3. Estimate energy content in kcal.\n- Barley soup with chicken: Assuming a denser soup with more chicken, approximately 60 kcal per 100g. For 89.3g: 89.3 * 0.6 = 53.58 kcal.\n- Olive oil: Energy content is about 884 kcal per 100g. For 20g: 20 * 8.84 = 176.8 kcal.\n- Pickled olives: Approximately 115 kcal per 100g. For 15g: 15 * 1.15 = 17.25 kcal.\n- Baguette bread: Approximately 270 kcal per 100g. For 50g: 50 * 2.7 = 135 kcal.\n\n4. Add energy values.\nTotal energy: 53.58 (soup) + 176.8 (olive oil) + 17.25 (olives) + 135 (bread) = 382.63 kcal.\n\nOutput: {\"total_energy\": 382.63}"], "pred": 382.63, "threshold": 50.0, "percent": false, "result": {"acc": false, "mae": 99.37, "mse": 9874.396900000002, "answer_rate": true}}

For 10.5g, this is approximately 0.105g of protein.\n- Tea with cow milk: The protein content will depend on the amount of milk used. Assuming a typical tea with milk ratio, let's estimate the milk content to be around 50% of the total weight (47.85g of milk). Cow milk has about 3.4g of protein per 100g. Therefore, 47.85g of milk contributes approximately 1.63g of protein.\n\nTotal estimated protein: 0.105g (biscuit) + 1.63g (milk in tea) = 1.735g protein.

Still below the stated 3.9g protein.\n\nFurther adjustment: Assume a higher protein content in the milk or additional protein source in the tea. If we assume a higher protein milk (e.g., fortified milk with 4.5g protein per 100g), then:\n76.56g of fortified milk contributes approximately 3.45g of protein.\n\nRevised total protein: 0.105g (biscuit) + 3.45g (fortified milk in tea) = 3.555g protein.

For 66g, this is 3.3g protein.\n- Potato chips: ~6.6g protein per 100g, so 30g provides 1.98g protein.\n- Carbonated cola: ~0g protein.\n\nTotal estimated protein: 0 + 0.2 + 3.3 + 1.98 + 0 = 5.48g protein. This is more than 20% below the stated 10.62g protein.\n\nAdjustment needed: The chicken rice likely has a higher protein content, possibly due to more chicken or a denser preparation. Let's assume a higher protein content of 11g protein per 100g for chicken rice.\nFor 66g, this is 7.26g protein.\n\nRevised total protein: 0 + 0.2 + 7.26 + 1.98 + 0 = 9.44g protein. This is still slightly below the stated 10.62g protein, but within a reasonable range considering potential variations in preparation.\n\n3. Estimate energy content in kcal.\n- Fruit nectar made from pear: ~47 kcal per 100g. For 200g: 200 * 0.47 = 94 kcal.\n- Toasted potatoes: ~93 kcal per 100g. For 10g: 10 * 0.93 = 9.3 kcal.\n- Chicken rice: Assuming 200 kcal per 100g. For 66g: 66 * 2 = 132 kcal.\n- Potato chips: ~536 kcal per 100g. For 30g: 30 * 5.36 = 160.8 kcal.\n- Carbonated cola: ~42 kcal per 100g. For 250g: 250 * 0.42 = 105 kcal.\n\n4.

This is more than the stated 11.11g protein, so the actual pork content is likely less.\n  Adjusting: If the dish is 50% pork ribs, then 81.85g of pork ribs would contribute approximately 16.37g protein. This is still above 11.11g, so the pork content is likely even lower.\n  Assuming 40% pork ribs: 65.48g of pork ribs would contribute approximately 13.1g protein. This is still above 11.11g, so the pork content is likely around 30%.\n  Assuming 30% pork ribs: 49.11g of pork ribs would contribute approximately 9.82g protein. This is slightly below 11.11g, so this is a reasonable assumption.\n- Steamed glutinous rice: Typically contains about 2g protein per 100g.\n  210g * 0.02 = 4.2g protein.\n- Total estimated protein: 9.82g (pork ribs) + 4.2g (rice) = 14.02g protein.\n  This is slightly above the stated 11.11g, but within a reasonable range considering estimation errors.\n\n3. Estimate energy content in kcal.\n- Bamboo shoots with pork ribs: Assuming 30% pork ribs, energy content is approximately 250 kcal per 100g for the pork ribs portion.\n  49.11g of pork ribs: 49.11 * 2.5 = 122.78 kcal\n  Bamboo shoots contribute minimal energy, so we focus on the pork ribs.\n- Steamed glutinous rice: Energy content is about 130 kcal per 100g.\n  210g * 1.3 = 273 kcal\n- Water: 0 kcal\n\n4.

Let's assume the beef is more concentrated.\n\nRecalculate for beef: Assume 30g protein per 100g, so 20g contributes 6g protein.\n\nRevised total protein: 0.3 + 0 + 6 + 7.7 + 0.3 + 0 + 35.2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 13.7 + 0 = 63.2g protein.\n\nStill below the stated 73.1g protein. Let's assume the dried fish is even more concentrated.\n\nRecalculate for dried fish: Assume 75g protein per 100g, so 11g contributes 8.3g protein.\n\nRevised total protein: 0.3 + 0 + 6 + 8.3 + 0.3 + 0 + 35.2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 13.7 + 0 = 63.8g protein.\n\nStill below the stated 73.1g protein. Let's assume the sorghum flour is even more concentrated.\n\nRecalculate for sorghum flour: Assume 15g protein per 100g, so 105g contributes 15.8g protein.\n\nRevised total protein: 0.3 + 0 + 6 + 8.3 + 0.3 + 0 + 35.2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 15.8 + 0 = 65.9g protein.\n\nStill below the stated 73.1g protein. Let's assume the rice is even more concentrated.\n\nRecalculate for rice: Assume 4g protein per 100g, so 1007g contributes 40.3g protein.\n\nRevised total protein: 0.3 + 0 + 6 + 8.3 + 0.3 + 0 + 40.3 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 15.8 + 0 = 71g protein.\n\nThis is within 20% of the stated 73.1g protein.\n\n3.

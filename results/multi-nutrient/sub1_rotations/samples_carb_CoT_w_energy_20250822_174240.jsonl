A typical maize porridge (thin) has ~50-60 kcal per 100g.\n729g * 0.55 = 400.95 kcal.\nTotal estimated: 547 + 401 = 948 kcal. This is far below the stated 1470 kcal.\nAdjustment needed: Either the maize porridge is more concentrated or oil quantity/energy is wrong.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 160 kcal/100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\nTry 729 * 1.27 = 926.8 kcal. (127 kcal/100g assumption)\nNew total: 547 (oil) + 927 (porridge) \u2248 1474 kcal, matching well. So, we assume maize porridge at 127 kcal/100g.\n3.

A typical maize porridge (thin) has ~50-60 kcal per 100g.\n729g * 0.55 = 400.95 kcal.\nTotal estimated: 547 + 401 = 948 kcal. This is far below the stated 1470 kcal.\nAdjustment needed: Either the maize porridge is more concentrated or oil quantity/energy is wrong.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 160 kcal/100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\nTry 729 * 1.27 = 926.8 kcal. (127 kcal/100g assumption)\nNew total: 547 (oil) + 927 (porridge) \u2248 1474 kcal, matching well. So, we assume maize porridge at 127 kcal/100g.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nRed palm oil: 0g carbs (pure fat)\nMaize porridge: At 127 kcal/100g, and assuming 80% of energy is from carbs:\n127 kcal * 0.90 = 114.3 kcal from carbs\nSo 114.3 / 4 = 28.6g carbs per 100g\nUsing 28.6g/100g as a realistic estimate:\n729g * 0.286 = 208.5g carbs\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 208.5}", "query": "I had 0.69g of Alfalfa Sprouts and 120g of Apple Green for dinner, along with a 350g Hawaiian Feast Pizza from Domino's.

Estimate energy contributions per item.\n- Alfalfa Sprouts: Negligible energy due to small amount.\n- Apple Green: Approximately 52 kcal per 100g, so 120g is about 62 kcal.\n- Hawaiian Feast Pizza: Domino's Hawaiian Feast Pizza is approximately 250 kcal per 100g, so 350g is about 875 kcal.\n- Lemon: Approximately 29 kcal per 100g, so 50.4g is about 14.6 kcal.\n- Musk Lime: Similar to lemon, approximately 29 kcal per 100g, so 12.1g is about 3.5 kcal.\n- Popia with Vegetarian Chicken: Assuming about 200 kcal per 100g, so 51.35g is about 102.7 kcal.\n- Syrup water and sugar: Assuming about 250 kcal per 100g, so 150g is about 375 kcal.\n\nTotal estimated energy: 62 + 875 + 14.6 + 3.5 + 102.7 + 375 = 1432.8 kcal.\n\nThe estimated total energy is significantly higher than the provided 1013 kcal. This suggests that the syrup water and sugar or pizza might have been overestimated in energy content. Let's adjust the syrup water and sugar to a more diluted form, assuming 100 kcal per 100g, so 150g is about 150 kcal.\n\nRevised total estimated energy: 62 + 875 + 14.6 + 3.5 + 102.7 + 150 = 1207.8 kcal.\n\nThis is still higher than 1013 kcal, but closer. We'll proceed with these estimates for carbohydrate calculations.\n\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\n- Alfalfa Sprouts: Negligible carbs due to small amount.\n- Apple Green: Approximately 14g carbs per 100g, so 120g is about 16.8g carbs.\n- Hawaiian Feast Pizza: Approximately 30g carbs per 100g, so 350g is about 105g carbs.\n- Lemon: Approximately 9g carbs per 100g, so 50.4g is about 4.5g carbs.\n- Musk Lime: Similar to lemon, approximately 9g carbs per 100g, so 12.1g is about 1.1g carbs.\n- Popia with Vegetarian Chicken: Assuming about 20g carbs per 100g, so 51.35g is about 10.3g carbs.\n- Syrup water and sugar: Assuming 25g carbs per 100g, so 150g is about 37.5g carbs.\n\n4.

Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- 14g of boiled Roselle leaves\n- 105g of millet flour that's been boiled\n- 19g of boiled peanuts\n- 14g of dried Roselle leaves\n- Salt (4g and another 17g)\n- 1g of stink beans\n- 1g of stock cubes\n\n2. Estimate energy contributions per item.\n- Boiled Roselle leaves: Very low in calories, approximately 23 kcal per 100g. For 14g: 23 * 0.14 = 3.22 kcal.\n- Millet flour (boiled): Approximately 119 kcal per 100g when cooked. For 105g: 119 * 1.05 = 124.95 kcal.\n- Boiled peanuts: Approximately 318 kcal per 100g. For 19g: 318 * 0.19 = 60.42 kcal.\n- Dried Roselle leaves: Typically used in small amounts for flavor, negligible calories.\n- Salt: 0 kcal.\n- Stink beans: Approximately 140 kcal per 100g. For 1g: 140 * 0.01 = 1.4 kcal.\n- Stock cubes: Approximately 250 kcal per 100g. For 1g: 250 * 0.01 = 2.5 kcal.\n\nTotal estimated energy: 3.22 + 124.95 + 60.42 + 1.4 + 2.5 = 192.49 kcal.\n\nThis is significantly lower than the stated 549 kcal. The discrepancy suggests that the millet flour or peanuts might be more concentrated or the serving sizes are underestimated. Let's assume the millet flour is more energy-dense, as it is the largest component.\n\nRe-estimate millet flour: Assume a denser preparation at 300 kcal per 100g.\nFor 105g: 300 * 1.05 = 315 kcal.\n\nNew total estimated energy: 3.22 + 315 + 60.42 + 1.4 + 2.5 = 382.54 kcal.\n\nThis is still lower than 549 kcal. The peanuts might also be more energy-dense or the serving size underestimated. Let's assume peanuts at 567 kcal per 100g (closer to raw peanuts).\n\nRe-estimate peanuts: 567 * 0.19 = 107.73 kcal.\n\nNew total estimated energy: 3.22 + 315 + 107.73 + 1.4 + 2.5 = 429.85 kcal.\n\nThis is still lower than 549 kcal. The millet flour might be even more energy-dense. Let's assume 400 kcal per 100g.\n\nRe-estimate millet flour: 400 * 1.05 = 420 kcal.\n\nNew total estimated energy: 3.22 + 420 + 107.73 + 1.4 + 2.5 = 534.85 kcal.\n\nThis is close enough to 549 kcal, considering possible rounding and preparation variations.\n\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\n- Boiled Roselle leaves: Negligible carbs.\n- Millet flour (boiled): At 400 kcal per 100g, approximately 80% from carbs. 400 * 0.8 = 320 kcal from carbs. 320 / 4 = 80g carbs per 100g. For 105g: 80 * 1.05 = 84g carbs.\n- Boiled peanuts: At 567 kcal per 100g, approximately 15% from carbs. 567 * 0.15 = 85.05 kcal from carbs. 85.05 / 4 = 21.26g carbs per 100g. For 19g: 21.26 * 0.19 = 4.04g carbs.\n- Dried Roselle leaves, salt, stink beans, stock cubes: Negligible carbs.\n\n4.

Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size. If no size is given, assume one standard serving based on common guidelines. Use USDA references for meals typically associated with Western/U.S. diets. For other regional or traditional meals, prefer FAO/WHO food composition data.\n2. If total energy (kcal) is provided, estimate the amount of energy each item contributes to the total. If the total energy estimated differs by more than 20%, reconsider the assumed form of every single relevant item (e.g. concentration, dry vs wet vs dehydrated). Repeat this step until a consistent energy estimate is obtained.\n3. For each item settled on, estimate its carbohydrate content in grams.\n4. Add the carbohydrates from all items. Respond with a dictionary object containing the total carbohydrates in grams as follows:\n{\"total_carbohydrates\": total grams of carbohydrates for the meal}\nFor the total carbohydrates, respond with just the numeric amount of carbohydrates without extra text.

Estimate energy contributions per item.\nRed palm oil: Energy content is about 884 kcal per 100g.\nFor 61.9g: 884 * 0.619 = 547 kcal\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: This depends heavily on its water content. A typical maize porridge (thin) has ~50-60 kcal per 100g.\n729g * 0.55 = 400.95 kcal.\nTotal estimated: 547 + 401 = 948 kcal. This is far below the stated 1470 kcal.\nAdjustment needed: Either the maize porridge is more concentrated or oil quantity/energy is wrong.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 160 kcal/100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\nTry 729 * 1.27 = 926.8 kcal. (127 kcal/100g assumption)\nNew total: 547 (oil) + 927 (porridge) \u2248 1474 kcal, matching well. So, we assume maize porridge at 127 kcal/100g.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nRed palm oil: 0g carbs (pure fat)\nMaize porridge: At 127 kcal/100g, and assuming 80% of energy is from carbs:\n127 kcal * 0.90 = 114.3 kcal from carbs\nSo 114.3 / 4 = 28.6g carbs per 100g\nUsing 28.6g/100g as a realistic estimate:\n729g * 0.286 = 208.5g carbs\n4.

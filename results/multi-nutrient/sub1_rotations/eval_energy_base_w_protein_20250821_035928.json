If provided, use this information to improve your estimate. If the serving size of any item in the meal is not specified, assume it is a single standard serving based on common nutritional guidelines (e.g., USDA).\nRespond with a dictionary object containing the total energy in kilocalories as follows:\n{\"total_energy\": total kilocalories for the serving}\nFor the total energy, respond with just the numeric amount of energy without extra text. If you don't know the answer, respond with:\n{\"total_energy\": -1}.\n\nQuery: \"This morning, I had a cup of oatmeal with half a sliced banana and a glass of orange juice. The meal contained 8 grams of protein.\"\nAnswer: {\"total_energy\": 312}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: {\"total_energy\": 277.2}\n\nQuery: \"Half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

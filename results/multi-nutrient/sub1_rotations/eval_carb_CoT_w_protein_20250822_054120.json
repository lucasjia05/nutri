    "prompt": "For the given query including a meal description, think step by step as follows:\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size. If no size is given, assume one standard serving based on common guidelines. Use USDA references for meals typically associated with Western/U.S. diets. For other regional or traditional meals, prefer FAO/WHO food composition data.\n2. If total protein (in grams) is provided, estimate the amount of protein each item contributes to the total. If the total protein estimated differs by more than 20%, reconsider the assumed form of every single relevant item (e.g. concentration, dry vs wet vs dehydrated). Repeat this step until a consistent protein estimate is obtained.\n3. For each item settled on, estimate its carbohydrate content in grams.\n4. Add the carbohydrates from all items. Respond with a dictionary object containing the total carbohydrates in grams as follows:\n{\"total_carbohydrates\": total grams of carbohydrates for the meal}\nFor the total carbohydrates, respond with just the numeric amount of carbohydrates without extra text. If you don't know the answer, set the value of \"total_carbohydrates\" to -1.\n\nFollow the format of the following examples when answering:\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- Scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs\n- 1 toast\n2. No protein provided.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs. 1 toast has 13g carbs.\n4. Add carbohydrate values.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"Half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The meal contained 6 grams of protein.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- Half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich\n2. Estimate protein contribution per item.\n1 peanut butter and jelly sandwich has 12.8g protein so half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich has (12.8*(1/2)) = 6.4g protein.\nMatches the provided total (no need to adjust assumptions).\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\n1 peanut butter and jelly sandwich has 50.6g carbs so half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich has (50.6*(1/2)) = 25.3g carbs.\n4. Add carbohydrate values.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 25.3}\n\nQuery: \"For breakfast, I had 61.9g of red palm oil and 729.0g of ready-to-eat maize porridge. The meal contained 20g protein.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- 61.9g of red palm oil\n- 729g of ready-to-eat maize porridge\n2. Estimate protein contributions per item.\nRed palm oil: ~0g protein.\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: Can vary. A watery porridge may be ~1-2g protein per 100g.\n729g * 0.02 = 14.6g protein.\nTotal estimated: 14.6g protein. This is below the stated 20g protein.\nAdjustment needed: The porridge is likely more concentrated.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 2.8g protein per 100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\n729 * 0.028 = 20.4g protein, which matches the provided 20g context.\nSo we assume a denser porridge at 2.8g protein/100g.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nRed palm oil: 0g carbs (pure fat).\nMaize porridge: At 2.8g protein/100g, a thick maize porridge has around 28.6g carbs per 100g\n729g * 0.286 = 208.5g carbs.\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\n0 + 208.5 = 208.5\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 208.5}",

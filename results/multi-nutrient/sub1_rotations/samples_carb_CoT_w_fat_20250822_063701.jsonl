This is below the stated 10g fat.\nAdjustment needed: The porridge is likely more concentrated.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 1.4g fat per 100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\n729 * 0.014 = 10.4g fat, which matches the provided 10g context.\nSo we assume porridge at 1.4g fat/100g.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nMaize porridge: At 1.4g fat/100g, a thick maize porridge has around 28.6g carbs per 100g.\n729g * 0.286 = 208.5g carbs.\n4.

This suggests the beef might be leaner than assumed or the serving size was slightly less. Adjusting the beef fat content to match the total fat provided, we assume a slightly leaner beef.\n\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\n- Beef bistec: Typically negligible carbohydrates.\n- Salad: Mixed vegetables with lemon juice and salt, approximately 1g of carbohydrates.\n- Pineapple drink with sugar: Assuming a sweetened drink, approximately 12g of carbohydrates per 100g. For 125g, it would be 15g of carbohydrates.\n- Cooked white rice: Approximately 28g of carbohydrates per 100g. For 28g, it would be 7.84g of carbohydrates.\n\n4.

Estimate fat contribution per item.\n- Brinjal Bhaji: Typically contains oil. Assume around 5g fat per 100g. For 77.6g, fat = 77.6 * 0.05 = 3.88g.\n- Chapati: Typically contains around 3.6g fat per 100g. For 52.7g, fat = 52.7 * 0.036 = 1.9g.\n- Milk tea: Typically contains around 1.5g fat per 100g. For 38.4g, fat = 38.4 * 0.015 = 0.576g.\n- Red gram dhal: Typically contains around 2g fat per 100g. For 29.3g, fat = 29.3 * 0.02 = 0.586g.\n- Rice: Typically contains around 0.3g fat per 100g.

This suggests the Brinjal Bhaji or another item may have been prepared with more oil or fat than typical. Adjusting Brinjal Bhaji to account for more oil, assume 20g fat per 100g for a richer preparation.\n\nRevised Brinjal Bhaji fat = 77.6 * 0.20 = 15.52g.\n\nRevised total fat = 15.52 + 1.9 + 0.576 + 0.586 + 0.207 = 18.789g.\n\nThis is still below 22.7g, but closer. Assume additional oil in preparation or other items.\n\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\n- Brinjal Bhaji: Assume 10g carbs per 100g. For 77.6g, carbs = 77.6 * 0.10 = 7.76g.\n- Chapati: Typically contains around 49g carbs per 100g. For 52.7g, carbs = 52.7 * 0.49 = 25.823g.\n- Milk tea: Typically contains around 10g carbs per 100g. For 38.4g, carbs = 38.4 * 0.10 = 3.84g.\n- Red gram dhal: Typically contains around 20g carbs per 100g. For 29.3g, carbs = 29.3 * 0.20 = 5.86g.\n- Rice: Typically contains around 28g carbs per 100g.

Estimate fat contribution per item.\n- Baking yeast: Negligible fat.\n- Boiled kapok flowers: Minimal fat.\n- Millet flour: Typically low in fat, but can contribute some. Assume around 1g fat per 100g, so 63g contributes about 0.63g fat.\n- Paprika powder: Minimal fat.\n- Iodised salt: No fat.\n- Fermented stink beans: Minimal fat.\n- Stock cubes: Can contain fat, but in small amounts. Assume around 0.5g fat for 1g.\n\nTotal estimated fat: 0.63g (millet flour) + 0.5g (stock cubes) = 1.13g fat. This is below the stated 3.5g fat.\n\nAdjustment needed: The millet flour or stock cubes may have a higher fat content than assumed. Let's assume millet flour contributes more fat, closer to 2g fat per 100g, which would be 1.26g for 63g. Recalculate:\n\n- Millet flour: 1.26g fat\n- Stock cubes: 0.5g fat\n\nTotal estimated fat: 1.26g + 0.5g = 1.76g fat. Still below 3.5g.\n\nAssume millet flour is even higher in fat, possibly due to processing or added ingredients. Assume 3g fat per 100g, which would be 1.89g for 63g.\n\nRecalculate:\n- Millet flour: 1.89g fat\n- Stock cubes: 0.5g fat\n\nTotal estimated fat: 1.89g + 0.5g = 2.39g fat. Still below 3.5g.\n\nAssume millet flour is 4g fat per 100g, which would be 2.52g for 63g.\n\nRecalculate:\n- Millet flour: 2.52g fat\n- Stock cubes: 0.5g fat\n\nTotal estimated fat: 2.52g + 0.5g = 3.02g fat. Closer to 3.5g, assume some variance in other items.\n\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\n- Baking yeast: Minimal carbs.\n- Boiled kapok flowers: Minimal carbs.\n- Millet flour: High in carbs. Assume around 70g carbs per 100g, so 63g contributes about 44.1g carbs.\n- Paprika powder: Minimal carbs.\n- Iodised salt: No carbs.\n- Fermented stink beans: Minimal carbs.\n- Stock cubes: Minimal carbs.\n\n4. Add carbohydrate values.\nTotal = 44.1g (millet flour) + minimal contributions from other items.\n\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 44.1}"], "pred": 44.1, "threshold": 7.5, "percent": false, "result": {"acc": true, "mae": 5.399999999999999, "mse": 29.159999999999986, "answer_rate": true}}

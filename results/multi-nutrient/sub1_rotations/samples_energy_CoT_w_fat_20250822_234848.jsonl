Estimate fat contributions per item.\n- Regular peanut butter and jelly sandwich: Peanut butter typically has about 50g of fat per 100g. Assuming the 112g is mostly peanut butter, let's estimate 56g of fat from the peanut butter alone. This is more than the total fat provided, so we need to adjust our assumption. Let's assume the 112g includes both peanut butter and jelly, with a typical distribution of 2 parts peanut butter to 1 part jelly. This means approximately 74.67g of peanut butter and 37.33g of jelly. The peanut butter would then contribute about 37.34g of fat (74.67g * 0.5), which is still more than the total fat provided.

Let's assume 40g of fat from the sandwich.\n- Whole strawberry milk: Whole milk typically has about 3.25g of fat per 100g. For 248g, this would be approximately 8.06g of fat.

This is more than 20% below the stated 10g fat.\nAdjustment needed: The maize porridge is likely more concentrated.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 1.5 grams/100g (closer to stiff ugali consistency).\nTry 729 * 0.014 = 10.2 grams (1.4g fat per 100g assumption), matching well. So, we assume maize porridge at 1.4g/100g.\n3.

Estimate fat contributions per item.\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: This depends heavily on its water content. A typical maize porridge (thin) has 1g fat per 100g.\n729g * 0.01 = 7.3 grams. This is more than 20% below the stated 10g fat.\nAdjustment needed: The maize porridge is likely more concentrated.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 1.5 grams/100g (closer to stiff ugali consistency).\nTry 729 * 0.014 = 10.2 grams (1.4g fat per 100g assumption), matching well. So, we assume maize porridge at 1.4g/100g.\n3. Estimate energy content in kcal.\nThick maize porridge: Based on FAO data for stiff maize porridge (e.g. ugali or sadza), energy content is typically 127 kcal/100g.\nFor 729g: 729 * 1.27 kcal = 926 kcal\n4.

For 250g, it contributes approximately 3.75g of fat.\n- Cream sauce: High in fat, often around 10g per 100g. Assuming 100g of cream sauce, it contributes approximately 10g of fat.\n- Poultry: Depending on the cut, around 5g of fat per 100g. Assuming 100g of poultry, it contributes approximately 5g of fat.\n- Veggies: Generally low in fat, around 0.5g per 100g. Assuming 100g of veggies, it contributes approximately 0.5g of fat.\n\nTotal estimated fat: 3.75g (pasta) + 10g (cream sauce) + 5g (poultry) + 0.5g (veggies) = 19.25g of fat.\n\nThis is significantly lower than the provided 31.1g of fat. Adjustments needed:\n- The cream sauce likely has a higher fat content or larger serving size. Let's assume a richer cream sauce or larger portion, contributing 20g of fat.\n\nRevised total estimated fat: 3.75g (pasta) + 20g (cream sauce) + 5g (poultry) + 0.5g (veggies) = 29.25g of fat, which is closer to the provided 31.1g.\n\n3. Estimate energy content in kcal.\n- Whole grain pasta: Approximately 350 kcal per 100g. For 250g, it contributes 875 kcal.\n- Cream sauce: Approximately 200 kcal per 100g. Assuming 100g, it contributes 200 kcal.\n- Poultry: Approximately 165 kcal per 100g. Assuming 100g, it contributes 165 kcal.\n- Veggies: Approximately 25 kcal per 100g.

Estimate fat contributions per item.\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: This depends heavily on its water content. A typical maize porridge (thin) has 1g fat per 100g.\n729g * 0.01 = 7.3 grams. This is more than 20% below the stated 10g fat.\nAdjustment needed: The maize porridge is likely more concentrated.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 1.5 grams/100g (closer to stiff ugali consistency).\nTry 729 * 0.014 = 10.2 grams (1.4g fat per 100g assumption), matching well. So, we assume maize porridge at 1.4g/100g.\n3. Estimate energy content in kcal.\nThick maize porridge: Based on FAO data for stiff maize porridge (e.g. ugali or sadza), energy content is typically 127 kcal/100g.\nFor 729g: 729 * 1.27 kcal = 926 kcal\n4.

The discrepancy suggests the hamburger roll or margarine might be richer in fat than assumed.

Estimate fat contributions per item.\n- Potato stew with lamb: A typical serving can have around 5g of fat per 100g. For 136.6g, this is approximately 6.83g of fat.\n- Tunisian salad with olive oil: Olive oil is a significant source of fat. Assuming a moderate amount of olive oil, the salad could have around 10g of fat per 100g. For 113.5g, this is approximately 11.35g of fat.\n- White bread and rolls: Typically, white bread has about 1g of fat per 100g. For 150g, this is approximately 1.5g of fat.\n- White sugar: Contains no fat.\n\nTotal estimated fat: 6.83g (stew) + 11.35g (salad) + 1.5g (bread) = 19.68g of fat.\n\nThe estimated total fat is less than the provided 26.45g. This suggests the salad might have more olive oil or the stew is richer in fat.

Recalculate total fat: 6.83g (stew) + 17.03g (salad) + 1.5g (bread) = 25.36g of fat, which is closer to the provided 26.45g.\n\n3.

For 113.5g, this is 227 kcal.\n- White bread and rolls: Approximately 265 kcal per 100g. For 150g, this is 397.5 kcal.\n- White sugar: Approximately 387 kcal per 100g.

Assume 7g fat for 70g.\n- Cooked beetroot: Very low in fat, approximately 0.1g per 100g. For 120g, approximately 0.12g fat.\n- Raw carrot: Very low in fat, approximately 0.2g per 100g. For 36g, approximately 0.072g fat.\n- Raw kale: Very low in fat, approximately 0.5g per 100g. For 60g, approximately 0.3g fat.\n- Water: 0g fat.\n- Whole grain rice: Approximately 1g fat per 100g.

Estimate fat contributions per item.\nBarley flour porridge: Barley flour typically has about 2.4 grams of fat per 100 grams of dry flour. However, the porridge is cooked, and the fat content can vary based on preparation. Assuming the porridge is made with water and no additional fat, the fat content should be lower than 6.8 grams for 108 grams of porridge.

Estimate energy content in kcal.\nBarley flour porridge: The energy content of barley flour is approximately 354 kcal per 100 grams of dry flour. For cooked porridge, the energy content is lower due to water content. Assuming a typical cooked porridge energy content of about 70 kcal per 100 grams, for 108 grams, the energy content would be approximately 75.6 kcal.

Estimate energy content in kcal.\n- Vitosha biscuits: Assuming 450 kcal per 100g (a typical value for biscuits), 40g would have 40 * 4.5 = 180 kcal.\n- 3% fat milk: Typically, 3% fat milk has about 60 kcal per 100g. For 200g, this is 200 * 0.6 = 120 kcal.\n\n4.

Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- 1g of baking yeast\n- 24g of boiled kapok flowers\n- 63g of millet flour (dried and boiled with husks)\n- 1g of paprika powder\n- 2g of iodised salt\n- 2g of fermented stink beans (boiled)\n- 1g of stock cubes\n\n2. Estimate fat contributions per item.\n- Baking yeast: Negligible fat.\n- Boiled kapok flowers: Minimal fat content.\n- Millet flour (dried and boiled with husks): Millet flour typically has about 4g of fat per 100g. For 63g, this is approximately 2.52g of fat.\n- Paprika powder: Minimal fat content.\n- Iodised salt: No fat.\n- Fermented stink beans (boiled): Minimal fat content.\n- Stock cubes: Typically contain some fat, but in 1g, it is minimal.\n\nTotal estimated fat: Approximately 2.52g from millet flour, which is close to the provided 3.5g. The remaining fat could be attributed to small contributions from other items or rounding differences.\n\n3. Estimate energy content in kcal.\n- Baking yeast: Approximately 3 kcal/g, so 1g = 3 kcal.\n- Boiled kapok flowers: Approximately 20 kcal/100g, so 24g = 4.8 kcal.\n- Millet flour (dried and boiled with husks): Approximately 378 kcal/100g, so 63g = 238.14 kcal.\n- Paprika powder: Approximately 282 kcal/100g, so 1g = 2.82 kcal.\n- Iodised salt: No energy.\n- Fermented stink beans (boiled): Approximately 140 kcal/100g, so 2g = 2.8 kcal.\n- Stock cubes: Approximately 250 kcal/100g, so 1g = 2.5 kcal.\n\n4. Add energy values and respond with total.\nTotal = 3 + 4.8 + 238.14 + 2.82 + 0 + 2.8 + 2.5 = 254.06\n\nOutput: {\"total_energy\": 254.06}"], "pred": 254.06, "threshold": 50.0, "percent": false, "result": {"acc": true, "mae": 10.939999999999998, "mse": 119.68359999999996, "answer_rate": true}}

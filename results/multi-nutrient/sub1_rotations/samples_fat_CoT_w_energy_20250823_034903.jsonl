Estimate energy contributions per item.\nThe total meal is stated to contain 307.5 kcal.

Let's assume 150 kcal per 100g for estimation.\n250g of pasta: 250 * 1.5 = 375 kcal\n\n- Tomato sauce: A basic tomato sauce might have around 30-50 kcal per 100g. Let's assume 40 kcal per 100g.\nAssuming 100g of tomato sauce: 100 * 0.4 = 40 kcal\n\n- Meat: Lean meat (e.g., chicken or beef) can have around 150-250 kcal per 100g. Let's assume 200 kcal per 100g.\nAssuming 100g of meat: 100 * 2 = 200 kcal\n\nTotal estimated: 375 (pasta) + 40 (sauce) + 200 (meat) = 615 kcal. This is more than 20% above the stated 307.5 kcal.\n\nAdjustment needed: The pasta or meat portion might be smaller, or the sauce might be more diluted. Let's assume a smaller portion of meat and sauce to match the total energy.\n\nRevised assumption:\n- Pasta: 250g, 375 kcal\n- Tomato sauce: 50g, 20 kcal\n- Meat: 50g, 100 kcal\n\nNew total: 375 (pasta) + 20 (sauce) + 100 (meat) = 495 kcal.

Estimate energy contributions per item.\nRed palm oil: Energy content is about 884 kcal per 100g.\nFor 61.9g: 884 * 0.619 = 547 kcal\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: This depends heavily on its water content. A typical maize porridge (thin) has ~50-60 kcal per 100g.\n729g * 0.55 = 400.95 kcal.\nTotal estimated: 547 + 401 = 948 kcal.

Estimate energy contributions per item.\n- Cucumber salad with olive oil: Olive oil is a significant source of calories. Assuming a small amount of olive oil (e.g., 10g) in the salad, olive oil has about 884 kcal per 100g, so 10g would contribute 88.4 kcal. Cucumber itself is very low in calories.\n- Potato stew with chicken and vegetable oil: Assuming a moderate amount of oil (e.g., 10g) and chicken, the stew could have around 150 kcal per 100g. For 100.5g, this would be approximately 150.75 kcal.\n- Vegetable soup with chicken and corn oil: Assuming a small amount of oil (e.g., 5g) and chicken, the soup could have around 50 kcal per 100g. For 130.7g, this would be approximately 65.35 kcal.\n\nTotal estimated energy: 88.4 (salad) + 150.75 (stew) + 65.35 (soup) = 304.5 kcal. This is less than the stated 340 kcal, but within 20% range, so assumptions are reasonable.\n\n3.

A typical maize porridge (thin) has ~50-60 kcal per 100g.\n729g * 0.55 = 400.95 kcal.\nTotal estimated: 547 + 401 = 948 kcal. This is more than 20% below the stated 1470 kcal.\nAdjustment needed: Either the maize porridge is more concentrated or oil quantity/energy is wrong.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 160 kcal/100g (closer to stiff ugali consistency).\nTry 729 * 1.27 = 926 kcal.

A typical maize porridge (thin) has ~50-60 kcal per 100g.\n729g * 0.55 = 400.95 kcal.\nTotal estimated: 547 + 401 = 948 kcal. This is more than 20% below the stated 1470 kcal.\nAdjustment needed: Either the maize porridge is more concentrated or oil quantity/energy is wrong.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 160 kcal/100g (closer to stiff ugali consistency).\nTry 729 * 1.27 = 926 kcal. (127 kcal/100g assumption)\nNew total: 547 (oil) + 926 (porridge) \u2248 1473 kcal, matching well. So, we assume maize porridge at 127 kcal/100g.\n3. Estimate fat content in grams.\nRed palm oil: fat content is about 100g per 100g (pure fat)\nFor 61.9g: 61.9 * 1 = 61.9g\nThick maize porridge: Based on FAO data for stiff maize porridge (e.g. ugali or sadza), fat content is typically 1.4g fat per 100g.\n729g * 0.014 = 10.2g fat.\n4.

The discrepancy suggests that either the millet flour or peanuts are more concentrated or there is an error in the provided energy content.\n\nLet's assume the millet flour is more concentrated, as it is a significant portion of the meal. If we assume a higher energy density for the millet flour, say 350 kcal per 100g (a more concentrated form), then:\n\nFor 105g: 350 * 1.05 = 367.5 kcal.\n\nRecalculate total energy: 3.22 + 367.5 + 60.42 + 3.92 + 0 + 0 + 1.4 + 2.5 = 439.96 kcal.\n\nThis is still below the stated 549 kcal. Let's assume the peanuts are also more concentrated, say 567 kcal per 100g (a more concentrated form):\n\nFor 19g: 567 * 0.19 = 107.73 kcal.\n\nRecalculate total energy: 3.22 + 367.5 + 107.73 + 3.92 + 0 + 0 + 1.4 + 2.5 = 486.27 kcal.\n\nThis is still below the stated 549 kcal. Given the complexity and potential variations in preparation, let's proceed with estimating fat content based on these assumptions.\n\n3. Estimate fat content in grams.\n- Boiled Roselle leaves: Negligible fat.\n- Boiled millet flour: Approximately 1.5g fat per 100g. For 105g: 1.5 * 1.05 = 1.575g fat.\n- Boiled peanuts: Approximately 49g fat per 100g. For 19g: 49 * 0.19 = 9.31g fat.\n- Dried Roselle leaves: Negligible fat.\n- Salt: No fat.\n- Stink beans: Approximately 5g fat per 100g. For 1g: 5 * 0.01 = 0.05g fat.\n- Stock cubes: Approximately 20g fat per 100g. For 1g: 20 * 0.01 = 0.2g fat.\n\n4. Add fat values and respond with total.\nTotal = 0 + 1.575 + 9.31 + 0 + 0 + 0.05 + 0.2 = 11.135g\n\nOutput: {\"total_fat\": 11.135}"], "pred": 11.135, "threshold": 2.5, "percent": false, "result": {"acc": true, "mae": 2.365, "mse": 5.593225000000001, "answer_rate": true}}

Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size. If no size is given, assume one standard serving based on common guidelines. Use USDA references for meals typically associated with Western/U.S. diets. For other regional or traditional meals, prefer FAO/WHO food composition data.\n2. If total energy (in kcal) is provided, estimate the amount of energy each item contributes to the total. If the total energy estimated differs by more than 20%, reconsider the assumed form of every single relevant item (e.g. concentration, dry vs wet vs dehydrated). Repeat this step until a consistent energy estimate is obtained.\n3. For each item settled on, estimate its fat content in grams.\n4. Add the fat values from all items. Respond with a dictionary object containing the total fat in grams as follows:\n{\"total_fat\": total fat in grams for the meal}\nFor the total fat, respond with just the numeric amount of fat without extra text. If you don't know the answer, set the value of \"total_fat\" to -1.\n\nFollow the format of the following examples when answering:\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- Scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs\n- 1 toast\n2. No energy provided.\n3. Estimate fat content in grams.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 16.5g fat.\n1 toast has 1g fat.\n4.

Estimate energy contributions per item.\n1 peanut butter and jelly sandwich has 404 kcal so half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich has (404*(1/2)) = 202 kcal.\nMatches the provided total (no need to adjust assumptions).\n3. Estimate fat content in grams.\n1 peanut butter and jelly sandwich has 18.6g fat so half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich has (18.6*(1/2)) = 9.3g fat.\n4. Add fat values and respond with total.\nOutput: {\"total_fat\": 9.3}\n\nQuery: \"For breakfast, I had 61.9g of red palm oil and 729.0g of ready-to-eat maize porridge.

Estimate energy contributions per item.\nRed palm oil: Energy content is about 884 kcal per 100g.\nFor 61.9g: 884 * 0.619 = 547 kcal\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: This depends heavily on its water content. A typical maize porridge (thin) has ~50-60 kcal per 100g.\n729g * 0.55 = 400.95 kcal.\nTotal estimated: 547 + 401 = 948 kcal. This is more than 20% below the stated 1470 kcal.\nAdjustment needed: Either the maize porridge is more concentrated or oil quantity/energy is wrong.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 160 kcal/100g (closer to stiff ugali consistency).\nTry 729 * 1.27 = 926 kcal. (127 kcal/100g assumption)\nNew total: 547 (oil) + 926 (porridge) \u2248 1473 kcal, matching well. So, we assume maize porridge at 127 kcal/100g.\n3. Estimate fat content in grams.\nRed palm oil: fat content is about 100g per 100g (pure fat)\nFor 61.9g: 61.9 * 1 = 61.9g\nThick maize porridge: Based on FAO data for stiff maize porridge (e.g. ugali or sadza), fat content is typically 1.4g fat per 100g.\n729g * 0.014 = 10.2g fat.\n4.

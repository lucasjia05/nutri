Estimate protein contributions per item.\nRed palm oil: ~0g protein.\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: This depends heavily on its water content. A typical maize porridge (thin) has 2g protein per 100g.\n729g * 0.02 = 14.6g protein.\nTotal estimated: 0 + 14.6 = 14.6g protein. This is more than 20% below the stated 20g protein.\nAdjustment needed: The porridge is likely more concentrated.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 2.8g protein per 100g (closer to stiff ugali consistency).\n729 * 0.028 = 20.4g protein, which matches the provided 20g context.\nSo we assume a denser porridge at 2.8g protein/100g.\n3. Estimate fat content in grams.\nRed palm oil: fat content is about 100g per 100g (pure fat)\nFor 61.9g: 61.9 * 1 = 61.9g\nThick maize porridge: Based on FAO data for stiff maize porridge (e.g. ugali or sadza), fat content is typically 1.4g fat per 100g.\n729g * 0.014 = 10.2g fat.\n4.

A typical maize porridge (thin) has 2g protein per 100g.\n729g * 0.02 = 14.6g protein.\nTotal estimated: 0 + 14.6 = 14.6g protein. This is more than 20% below the stated 20g protein.\nAdjustment needed: The porridge is likely more concentrated.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 2.8g protein per 100g (closer to stiff ugali consistency).\n729 * 0.028 = 20.4g protein, which matches the provided 20g context.\nSo we assume a denser porridge at 2.8g protein/100g.\n3. Estimate fat content in grams.\nRed palm oil: fat content is about 100g per 100g (pure fat)\nFor 61.9g: 61.9 * 1 = 61.9g\nThick maize porridge: Based on FAO data for stiff maize porridge (e.g. ugali or sadza), fat content is typically 1.4g fat per 100g.\n729g * 0.014 = 10.2g fat.\n4.

A typical maize porridge (thin) has 2g protein per 100g.\n729g * 0.02 = 14.6g protein.\nTotal estimated: 0 + 14.6 = 14.6g protein. This is more than 20% below the stated 20g protein.\nAdjustment needed: The porridge is likely more concentrated.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 2.8g protein per 100g (closer to stiff ugali consistency).\n729 * 0.028 = 20.4g protein, which matches the provided 20g context.\nSo we assume a denser porridge at 2.8g protein/100g.\n3. Estimate fat content in grams.\nRed palm oil: fat content is about 100g per 100g (pure fat)\nFor 61.9g: 61.9 * 1 = 61.9g\nThick maize porridge: Based on FAO data for stiff maize porridge (e.g. ugali or sadza), fat content is typically 1.4g fat per 100g.\n729g * 0.014 = 10.2g fat.\n4.

A typical maize porridge (thin) has 2g protein per 100g.\n729g * 0.02 = 14.6g protein.\nTotal estimated: 0 + 14.6 = 14.6g protein. This is more than 20% below the stated 20g protein.\nAdjustment needed: The porridge is likely more concentrated.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 2.8g protein per 100g (closer to stiff ugali consistency).\n729 * 0.028 = 20.4g protein, which matches the provided 20g context.\nSo we assume a denser porridge at 2.8g protein/100g.\n3. Estimate fat content in grams.\nRed palm oil: fat content is about 100g per 100g (pure fat)\nFor 61.9g: 61.9 * 1 = 61.9g\nThick maize porridge: Based on FAO data for stiff maize porridge (e.g. ugali or sadza), fat content is typically 1.4g fat per 100g.\n729g * 0.014 = 10.2g fat.\n4.

Estimate fat content in grams.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 16.5g fat.\n1 toast has 1g fat.\n4. Add fat values and respond with total.\nTotal = (16.5 + 1) = 17.5\nOutput: {\"total_fat\": 17.5}\n\nQuery: \"Half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The meal contained 6 grams of protein.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- Half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich\n2. Estimate protein contributions per item.\n1 peanut butter and jelly sandwich has 12.8g protein so half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich has (12.8*(1/2)) = 6.4g protein.\nMatches the provided total (no need to adjust assumptions).\n3.

Estimate fat content in grams.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 16.5g fat.\n1 toast has 1g fat.\n4. Add fat values and respond with total.\nTotal = (16.5 + 1) = 17.5\nOutput: {\"total_fat\": 17.5}\n\nQuery: \"Half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

Therefore, protein content is approximately 85.5g * 0.25 = 21.4g protein.\n- Boiled orange sweet potato: Typically has about 1.6g of protein per 100g.\n230g * 0.016 = 3.7g protein.\n\nTotal estimated protein: 21.4g (groundnuts) + 3.7g (sweet potato) = 25.1g protein.\nThis is less than the stated 27.9g protein, which is more than 20% below the stated amount.

    "prompt": "For the given query including a meal description, think step by step as follows:\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size. If no size is given, assume one standard serving based on common guidelines. Use USDA references for meals typically associated with Western/U.S. diets. For other regional or traditional meals, prefer FAO/WHO food composition data.\n2. If total fat (in grams) is provided, estimate the amount of fat each item contributes to the total. If the total fat estimated differs by more than 20%, reconsider the assumed form of every single relevant item (e.g. concentration, dry vs wet vs dehydrated). Repeat this step until a consistent fat estimate is obtained.\n3. For each item settled on, estimate its carbohydrate content in grams.\n4. Add the carbohydrates from all items. Respond with a dictionary object containing the total carbohydrates in grams as follows:\n{\"total_carbohydrates\": total grams of carbohydrates for the meal}\nFor the total carbohydrates, respond with just the numeric amount of carbohydrates without extra text. If you don't know the answer, set the value of \"total_carbohydrates\" to -1.\n\nFollow the format of the following examples when answering:\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- Scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs\n- 1 toast\n2. No fat provided.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs. 1 toast has 13g carbs.\n4. Add carbohydrate values.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"Half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The meal contained 9 grams of fat.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- Half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich\n2. Estimate fat contribution per item.\n1 peanut butter and jelly sandwich has 18.6g fat so half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich has (18.6*(1/2)) = 9.3g fat.\nMatches the provided total (no need to adjust assumptions).\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\n1 peanut butter and jelly sandwich has 50.6g carbs so half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich has (50.6*(1/2)) = 25.3g carbs.\n4. Add carbohydrate values.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 25.3}\n\nQuery: \"For breakfast, I had 729.0g of ready-to-eat maize porridge. The meal contained 10g fat.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- 729g of ready-to-eat maize porridge\n2. Estimate fat contributions per item.\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: Can vary. A thin porridge may be ~1g fat per 100g.\n729g * 0.01 = 7.3g fat. This is below the stated 10g fat.\nAdjustment needed: The porridge is likely more concentrated.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 1.4g fat per 100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\n729 * 0.014 = 10.4g fat, which matches the provided 10g context.\nSo we assume porridge at 1.4g fat/100g.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nMaize porridge: At 1.4g fat/100g, a thick maize porridge has around 28.6g carbs per 100g.\n729g * 0.286 = 208.5g carbs.\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 208.5}",

    "prompt": "For the given query including a meal description, think step by step as follows:\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size. If no size is given, assume one standard serving based on common guidelines. Use USDA references for meals typically associated with Western/U.S. diets. For other regional or traditional meals, prefer FAO/WHO food composition data.\n2. If total protein (in grams) is provided, estimate the amount of protein each item contributes to the total. If the total protein estimated differs by more than 20%, reconsider the assumed form of every single relevant item (e.g. concentration, dry vs wet vs dehydrated). Repeat this step until a consistent protein estimate is obtained.\n3. For each item settled on, estimate its fat content in grams.\n4. Add the fat values from all items. Respond with a dictionary object containing the total fat in grams as follows:\n{\"total_fat\": total fat in grams for the meal}\nFor the total fat, respond with just the numeric amount of fat without extra text. If you don't know the answer, set the value of \"total_fat\" to -1.\n\nFollow the format of the following examples when answering:\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- Scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs\n- 1 toast\n2. No protein provided.\n3. Estimate fat content in grams.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 16.5g fat.\n1 toast has 1g fat.\n4. Add fat values and respond with total.\nTotal = (16.5 + 1) = 17.5\nOutput: {\"total_fat\": 17.5}\n\nQuery: \"Half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The meal contained 6 grams of protein.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- Half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich\n2. Estimate protein contributions per item.\n1 peanut butter and jelly sandwich has 12.8g protein so half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich has (12.8*(1/2)) = 6.4g protein.\nMatches the provided total (no need to adjust assumptions).\n3. Estimate fat content in grams.\n1 peanut butter and jelly sandwich has 18.6g fat so half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich has (18.6*(1/2)) = 9.3g fat.\n4. Add fat values and respond with total.\nOutput: {\"total_fat\": 9.3}\n\nQuery: \"For breakfast, I had 61.9g of red palm oil and 729.0g of ready-to-eat maize porridge. The meal contained 20g protein.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- 61.9g of red palm oil\n- 729g of ready-to-eat maize porridge\n2. Estimate protein contributions per item.\nRed palm oil: ~0g protein.\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: This depends heavily on its water content. A typical maize porridge (thin) has 2g protein per 100g.\n729g * 0.02 = 14.6g protein.\nTotal estimated: 0 + 14.6 = 14.6g protein. This is more than 20% below the stated 20g protein.\nAdjustment needed: The porridge is likely more concentrated.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 2.8g protein per 100g (closer to stiff ugali consistency).\n729 * 0.028 = 20.4g protein, which matches the provided 20g context.\nSo we assume a denser porridge at 2.8g protein/100g.\n3. Estimate fat content in grams.\nRed palm oil: fat content is about 100g per 100g (pure fat)\nFor 61.9g: 61.9 * 1 = 61.9g\nThick maize porridge: Based on FAO data for stiff maize porridge (e.g. ugali or sadza), fat content is typically 1.4g fat per 100g.\n729g * 0.014 = 10.2g fat.\n4. Add fat values and respond with total.\nTotal = 61.9 + 10.2 = 72.1\nOutput: {\"total_fat\": 72.1}",

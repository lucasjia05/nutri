Assuming the porridge is primarily made with low-fat milk and cornmeal, let's estimate:\n  - If the porridge is about 50% milk, then 150.5g of low-fat milk would contribute approximately 1.5g of fat.\n  - Cornmeal itself has a small amount of fat, approximately 1.2g per 100g.

This is more than 20% below the stated 10g fat.\nAdjustment needed: The maize porridge is likely more concentrated.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 1.5 grams/100g (closer to stiff ugali consistency).\nTry 729 * 0.014 = 10.2 grams (1.4g fat per 100g assumption), matching well. So, we assume maize porridge at 1.4g/100g.\n3. Estimate protein content in grams.\nThick maize porridge: Based on FAO data for stiff maize porridge (e.g. ugali or sadza), protein content is typically 2.8g protein per 100g.\n729g * 0.028 = 20.4g protein.\n4.

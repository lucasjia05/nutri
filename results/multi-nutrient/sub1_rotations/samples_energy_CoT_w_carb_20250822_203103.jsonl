Assuming the strawberry milk is about 10g carbs per 100g, then 248g contributes 24.8g of carbs.\n\nTotal estimated carbs: 32.93g (sandwich) + 24.8g (milk) = 57.73g.

A typical maize porridge (thin) has 15g carbs per 100g.\n729g * 0.15 = 109.35 grams.\nTotal estimated: 0 + 109.35 = 109.35g carbs. This is far below the stated 209 grams.\nAdjustment needed: The maize porridge is likely more concentrated.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 30 grams/100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\nTry 729 * 0.286 = 208.5 grams. (28.6g/100g assumption)\nNew total: 0 (oil) + 208.5 (porridge) \u2248 208.5 grams, matching well. So, we assume maize porridge at 28.6g/100g.\n3.

Estimate carb contributions per item.\nRed palm oil: Carb content is about 0g per 100g.\nFor 61.9g: 61.9 * 0 = 0g\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: This depends heavily on its water content. A typical maize porridge (thin) has 15g carbs per 100g.\n729g * 0.15 = 109.35 grams.\nTotal estimated: 0 + 109.35 = 109.35g carbs. This is far below the stated 209 grams.\nAdjustment needed: The maize porridge is likely more concentrated.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 30 grams/100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\nTry 729 * 0.286 = 208.5 grams. (28.6g/100g assumption)\nNew total: 0 (oil) + 208.5 (porridge) \u2248 208.5 grams, matching well. So, we assume maize porridge at 28.6g/100g.\n3. Estimate energy content in kcal.\nRed palm oil: Energy content is about 884 kcal per 100g.\nFor 61.9g: 884 * 0.619 = 547 kcal\nThick maize porridge: Based on FAO data for stiff maize porridge (e.g. ugali or sadza), energy content is typically 127 kcal/100g.\nFor 729g: 729 * 1.27 kcal = 926.8 kcal\n4.

If total carbohydrates (in grams) are provided, estimate the amount of carbs each item contributes to the total. If the total carbs estimated differs by more than 20%, reconsider the assumed form of every single relevant item (e.g. concentration, dry vs wet vs dehydrated). Repeat this step until a consistent carbohydrate estimate is obtained.\n3. For each item settled on, estimate its energy content in kcal.\n4. Add the energy values from all items. Respond with a dictionary object containing the total energy in kcal as follows:\n{\"total_energy\": total energy in kcal for the meal}\nFor the total energy, respond with just the numeric amount of energy without extra text.

Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 30 grams/100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\nTry 729 * 0.286 = 208.5 grams.

Assuming the cucumber salad is mostly cucumber, it might contribute around 1g of carbohydrates.\n\nTotal estimated carbohydrates: 0 (fish) + 49 (bread) + 1 (salad) = 50g of carbohydrates.\n\nThe provided total is 60.37g, which is higher than our estimate. This suggests the cucumber salad might contain additional ingredients contributing to the carbs, or the bread might be a type with higher carbohydrate content. However, the difference is within a reasonable range, so we'll proceed with these assumptions.\n\n3. Estimate energy content in kcal.\n- Raw blue fish: Energy content is about 206 kcal per 100g.\n  For 80g: 206 * 0.8 = 164.8 kcal\n- Unsalted bread: Energy content is about 265 kcal per 100g.\n  For 100g: 265 kcal\n- Cucumber salad with corn oil: Assuming the salad is mostly cucumber with some corn oil, the energy content is primarily from the oil. Corn oil is about 884 kcal per 100g.\n  For 40.1g: 884 * 0.401 = 354.5 kcal\n\n4.

Estimate carb contributions per item.\n- Coffee with milk: Typically, coffee itself has negligible carbs. Milk (assuming whole milk) has about 4.8g of carbs per 100g. For 200g of coffee with milk, let's assume 50% milk, which is 100g of milk. So, 100g of milk contributes 4.8g of carbs.\n- Breadsticks: Typically have about 70g of carbs per 100g. For 30g, this is 30 * 0.7 = 21g of carbs.\n- Porridge: Assuming it's made from oats, which have about 12g of carbs per 100g when cooked. For 195g, this is 195 * 0.12 = 23.4g of carbs.\n- Sugar: 100g of sugar has 100g of carbs. For 20g, this is 20g of carbs.\n\nTotal estimated carbs: 4.8 (coffee with milk) + 21 (breadsticks) + 23.4 (porridge) + 20 (sugar) = 69.2g of carbs.\n\nThe estimated total is significantly lower than the provided 107.37g of carbs. Let's reconsider the porridge, as it can vary significantly based on preparation.\n\nAssuming a denser porridge, such as one made with less water or additional ingredients, let's try 30g of carbs per 100g. For 195g, this would be 195 * 0.3 = 58.5g of carbs.\n\nNew total: 4.8 (coffee with milk) + 21 (breadsticks) + 58.5 (porridge) + 20 (sugar) = 104.3g of carbs, which is closer to the provided 107.37g.\n\n3. Estimate energy content in kcal.\n- Coffee with milk: Assuming 50% milk, 100g of whole milk has about 62 kcal. For 100g, this is 62 kcal.\n- Breadsticks: Typically have about 450 kcal per 100g. For 30g, this is 30 * 4.5 = 135 kcal.\n- Porridge: Assuming a denser porridge with 30g of carbs per 100g, energy content is about 150 kcal per 100g. For 195g, this is 195 * 1.5 = 292.5 kcal.\n- Sugar: 100g of sugar has about 387 kcal. For 20g, this is 20 * 3.87 = 77.4 kcal.\n\n4.

A typical maize porridge (thin) has 15g carbs per 100g.\n729g * 0.15 = 109.35 grams.\nTotal estimated: 0 + 109.35 = 109.35g carbs. This is far below the stated 209 grams.\nAdjustment needed: The maize porridge is likely more concentrated.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 30 grams/100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\nTry 729 * 0.286 = 208.5 grams.

This suggests the yogurt might be sweetened or flavored, which can increase carbohydrate content. Let's assume the yogurt is sweetened, contributing more carbohydrates.\n\nRevised assumption for yogurt: Sweetened yogurt can have around 20g of carbohydrates per 100g. For 180g, it contributes 36g of carbohydrates.\n\nRevised total estimated carbohydrates: 0 (water) + 1.12 (omelet) + 28 (rice) + 36 (yogurt) = 65.12g of carbohydrates.\n\nThis is still lower than the provided total. Let's assume the yogurt is even more sweetened or contains added fruits, contributing more carbohydrates.\n\nFinal assumption for yogurt: Highly sweetened or fruit yogurt can have around 30g of carbohydrates per 100g.

Estimate carb contributions per item.\n- Baking yeast: Minimal carbs, approximately 0.5g per gram. For 1g: 0.5g carbs.\n- Boiled kapok flowers: Minimal carbs, approximately 0.1g per gram. For 24g: 2.4g carbs.\n- Millet flour (dried and boiled with husks): High in carbs, approximately 70g per 100g. For 63g: 44.1g carbs.\n- Paprika powder: Minimal carbs, approximately 0.5g per gram. For 1g: 0.5g carbs.\n- Iodised salt: No carbs.\n- Fermented stink beans (boiled): Minimal carbs, approximately 0.1g per gram.

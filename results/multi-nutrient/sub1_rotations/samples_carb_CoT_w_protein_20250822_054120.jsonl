However, the given amount is 112.0g, which is significantly more. Assuming the 112.0g is the combined weight of peanut butter and jelly, let's estimate the protein content. Peanut butter has about 25g protein per 100g, so 112g of peanut butter would have approximately 28g protein. However, since this includes jelly, let's assume 56g peanut butter and 56g jelly. 56g peanut butter has about 14g protein. Jelly has negligible protein. White bread typically adds around 4g protein. Total estimated protein for the sandwich: 14 + 4 = 18g protein.\n\n- Whole strawberry milk: Whole milk has about 3.4g protein per 100g. 248g of whole milk would have approximately 8.4g protein. However, since the total meal protein is 20.43g, and the sandwich is estimated at 18g, the milk must contribute the remaining 2.43g protein. This suggests the milk is closer to 2.43g protein, which is consistent with a smaller portion of milk or a different composition.\n\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\n- Peanut butter and jelly sandwich: A typical sandwich with 2 tablespoons of peanut butter and jelly on white bread has around 50.6g carbs. Given the larger amount of peanut butter and jelly, let's adjust. Assuming 56g peanut butter and 56g jelly, with white bread, the carbs would be higher. Peanut butter has about 20g carbs per 100g, so 56g has about 11.2g carbs. Jelly has about 50g carbs per 100g, so 56g has about 28g carbs. White bread typically adds around 26g carbs.

Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs. 1 toast has 13g carbs.\n4. Add carbohydrate values.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"Half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs. 1 toast has 13g carbs.\n4. Add carbohydrate values.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"Half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The meal contained 6 grams of protein.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- Half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich\n2. Estimate protein contribution per item.\n1 peanut butter and jelly sandwich has 12.8g protein so half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich has (12.8*(1/2)) = 6.4g protein.\nMatches the provided total (no need to adjust assumptions).\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\n1 peanut butter and jelly sandwich has 50.6g carbs so half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich has (50.6*(1/2)) = 25.3g carbs.\n4.

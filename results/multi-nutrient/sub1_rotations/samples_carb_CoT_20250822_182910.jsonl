This is far below the stated 1470 kcal.\nAdjustment needed: Either the maize porridge is more concentrated or oil quantity/energy is wrong.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 160 kcal/100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\nTry 729 * 1.27 = 926.8 kcal. (127 kcal/100g assumption)\nNew total: 547 (oil) + 927 (porridge) \u2248 1474 kcal, matching well. So, we assume maize porridge at 127 kcal/100g.\n3.

Estimate energy contributions per item.\nRed palm oil: Energy content is about 884 kcal per 100g.\nFor 61.9g: 884 * 0.619 = 547 kcal\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: This depends heavily on its water content. A typical maize porridge (thin) has ~50-60 kcal per 100g.\n729g * 0.55 = 400.95 kcal.\nTotal estimated: 547 + 401 = 948 kcal. This is far below the stated 1470 kcal.\nAdjustment needed: Either the maize porridge is more concentrated or oil quantity/energy is wrong.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 160 kcal/100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\nTry 729 * 1.27 = 926.8 kcal. (127 kcal/100g assumption)\nNew total: 547 (oil) + 927 (porridge) \u2248 1474 kcal, matching well. So, we assume maize porridge at 127 kcal/100g.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nRed palm oil: 0g carbs (pure fat)\nMaize porridge: At 127 kcal/100g, and assuming 80% of energy is from carbs:\n127 kcal * 0.90 = 114.3 kcal from carbs\nSo 114.3 / 4 = 28.6g carbs per 100g\nUsing 28.6g/100g as a realistic estimate:\n729g * 0.286 = 208.5g carbs\n4.

Repeat this step until a consistent energy estimate is obtained.\n3. For each item settled on, estimate its carbohydrate content in grams.\n4. Add the carbohydrates from all items. Respond with a dictionary object containing the total carbohydrates in grams as follows:\n{\"total_carbohydrates\": total grams of carbohydrates for the meal}\nFor the total carbohydrates, respond with just the numeric amount of carbohydrates without extra text. If you don't know the answer, set the value of \"total_carbohydrates\" to -1.\n\nFollow the format of the following examples when answering:\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- Scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs\n- 1 toast\n2. No energy provided.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs. 1 toast has 13g carbs.\n4. Add carbohydrate values.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"Half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The meal contained 202 kcal.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- Half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich\n2. Estimate energy contribution per item.\n1 peanut butter and jelly sandwich has 404 kcal so half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich has (404*(1/2)) = 202 kcal.\nMatches the provided total (no need to adjust assumptions).\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\n1 peanut butter and jelly sandwich has 50.6g carbs so half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich has (50.6*(1/2)) = 25.3g carbs.\n4. Add carbohydrate values.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 25.3}\n\nQuery: \"For breakfast, I had 61.9g of red palm oil and 729.0g of ready-to-eat maize porridge. The meal contained 1470 kcal.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- 61.9g of red palm oil\n- 729g of ready-to-eat maize porridge\n2. Estimate energy contributions per item.\nRed palm oil: Energy content is about 884 kcal per 100g.\nFor 61.9g: 884 * 0.619 = 547 kcal\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: This depends heavily on its water content. A typical maize porridge (thin) has ~50-60 kcal per 100g.\n729g * 0.55 = 400.95 kcal.\nTotal estimated: 547 + 401 = 948 kcal. This is far below the stated 1470 kcal.\nAdjustment needed: Either the maize porridge is more concentrated or oil quantity/energy is wrong.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 160 kcal/100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\nTry 729 * 1.27 = 926.8 kcal. (127 kcal/100g assumption)\nNew total: 547 (oil) + 927 (porridge) \u2248 1474 kcal, matching well. So, we assume maize porridge at 127 kcal/100g.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nRed palm oil: 0g carbs (pure fat)\nMaize porridge: At 127 kcal/100g, and assuming 80% of energy is from carbs:\n127 kcal * 0.90 = 114.3 kcal from carbs\nSo 114.3 / 4 = 28.6g carbs per 100g\nUsing 28.6g/100g as a realistic estimate:\n729g * 0.286 = 208.5g carbs\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 208.5}", "query": "For breakfast, I have 1g of baking yeast, 24g of boiled kapok flowers, and 63g of millet flour that was dried and boiled with husks.

No energy provided, so we will estimate based on typical values.\n\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams for each item:\n- Baking yeast: Typically contains about 37g of carbs per 100g. For 1g: 0.37g carbs.\n- Boiled kapok flowers: Limited data, but generally low in carbs. Assume negligible carbs.\n- Millet flour (dried and boiled with husks): Millet flour has about 73g of carbs per 100g.

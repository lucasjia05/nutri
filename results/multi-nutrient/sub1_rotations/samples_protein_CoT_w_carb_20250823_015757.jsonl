Let's assume 25g carbs per 100g for a balanced estimate.\n\nFor 250g of pasta with cream sauce and seafood:\n250g * 0.25 = 62.5g carbs\n\nFor 250g of pasta with cream sauce and poultry:\n250g * 0.25 = 62.5g carbs\n\nTotal estimated carbs: 62.5 + 62.5 = 125g carbs\n\nThis is more than 20% above the stated 83.57 grams. Adjustment needed: The pasta or sauce might be less carb-dense than assumed. Let's try a lower carb density.\n\nAssume 16.7g carbs per 100g (closer to a lighter sauce or less pasta):\nFor 250g of pasta with cream sauce and seafood:\n250g * 0.167 = 41.75g carbs\n\nFor 250g of pasta with cream sauce and poultry:\n250g * 0.167 = 41.75g carbs\n\nNew total: 41.75 + 41.75 = 83.5g carbs, matching well. So, we assume pasta with cream sauce at 16.7g/100g.\n\n3. Estimate protein content in grams.\nPasta with cream sauce and seafood: Seafood typically adds significant protein. Assume 10g protein per 100g for seafood pasta.\n250g * 0.10 = 25g protein\n\nPasta with cream sauce and poultry: Poultry also adds significant protein. Assume 10g protein per 100g for poultry pasta.\n250g * 0.10 = 25g protein\n\n4.

Estimate carb contributions per item.\nRed palm oil: Carb content is about 0g per 100g.\nFor 61.9g: 61.9 * 0 = 0g\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: This depends heavily on its water content. A typical maize porridge (thin) has 15g carbs per 100g.\n729g * 0.15 = 109.35 grams.\nTotal estimated: 0 + 109.35 = 109.35g carbs. This is more than 20% below the stated 209 grams.\nAdjustment needed: The maize porridge is likely more concentrated.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 30 grams/100g (closer to stiff ugali consistency).\nTry 729 * 0.286 = 208.5 grams. (28.6g/100g assumption)\nNew total: 0 (oil) + 208.5 (porridge) \u2248 208.5 grams, matching well. So, we assume maize porridge at 28.6g/100g.\n3. Estimate protein content in grams.\nRed palm oil: 0g protein (pure fat)\nThick maize porridge: Based on FAO data for stiff maize porridge (e.g. ugali or sadza), protein content is typically 2.8g protein per 100g.\n729g * 0.028 = 20.4g protein.\n4.

Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- 61.9g of red palm oil\n- 729g of ready-to-eat maize porridge\n2. Estimate carb contributions per item.\nRed palm oil: Carb content is about 0g per 100g.\nFor 61.9g: 61.9 * 0 = 0g\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: This depends heavily on its water content. A typical maize porridge (thin) has 15g carbs per 100g.\n729g * 0.15 = 109.35 grams.\nTotal estimated: 0 + 109.35 = 109.35g carbs. This is more than 20% below the stated 209 grams.\nAdjustment needed: The maize porridge is likely more concentrated.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 30 grams/100g (closer to stiff ugali consistency).\nTry 729 * 0.286 = 208.5 grams. (28.6g/100g assumption)\nNew total: 0 (oil) + 208.5 (porridge) \u2248 208.5 grams, matching well. So, we assume maize porridge at 28.6g/100g.\n3. Estimate protein content in grams.\nRed palm oil: 0g protein (pure fat)\nThick maize porridge: Based on FAO data for stiff maize porridge (e.g. ugali or sadza), protein content is typically 2.8g protein per 100g.\n729g * 0.028 = 20.4g protein.\n4.

Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size. If no size is given, assume one standard serving based on common guidelines. Use USDA references for meals typically associated with Western/U.S. diets. For other regional or traditional meals, prefer FAO/WHO food composition data.\n2. If total carbohydrates (in grams) are provided, estimate the amount of carbs each item contributes to the total. If the total carbohydrates estimated differ by more than 20%, reconsider the assumed form of every single relevant item (e.g. concentration, dry vs wet vs dehydrated). Repeat this step until a consistent carbohydrate estimate is obtained.\n3. For each item settled on, estimate its protein content in grams.\n4. Add the protein values from all items. Respond with a dictionary object containing the total protein in grams as follows:\n{\"total_protein\": total grams of protein for the meal}\nFor the total protein, respond with just the numeric amount of protein without extra text.

Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- Scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs\n- 1 toast\n2. No carbohydrates provided.\n3. Estimate protein content in grams.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 12.7g protein.\n1 toast has 2.6g protein.\n4.

Estimate carb contributions per item.\n1 peanut butter and jelly sandwich has 50.6g carbs so half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich has (50.6*(1/2)) = 25.3g carbs.\nMatches the provided total (no need to adjust assumptions).\n3. Estimate protein content in grams.\n1 peanut butter and jelly sandwich has 12.8g protein so half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich has (12.8*(1/2)) = 6.4g protein.\n4.

Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- 61.9g of red palm oil\n- 729g of ready-to-eat maize porridge\n2. Estimate carb contributions per item.\nRed palm oil: Carb content is about 0g per 100g.\nFor 61.9g: 61.9 * 0 = 0g\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: This depends heavily on its water content. A typical maize porridge (thin) has 15g carbs per 100g.\n729g * 0.15 = 109.35 grams.\nTotal estimated: 0 + 109.35 = 109.35g carbs. This is more than 20% below the stated 209 grams.\nAdjustment needed: The maize porridge is likely more concentrated.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 30 grams/100g (closer to stiff ugali consistency).\nTry 729 * 0.286 = 208.5 grams.

Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size. If no size is given, assume one standard serving based on common guidelines. Use USDA references for meals typically associated with Western/U.S. diets. For other regional or traditional meals, prefer FAO/WHO food composition data.\n2. If total carbohydrates (in grams) are provided, estimate the amount of carbs each item contributes to the total. If the total carbohydrates estimated differ by more than 20%, reconsider the assumed form of every single relevant item (e.g. concentration, dry vs wet vs dehydrated). Repeat this step until a consistent carbohydrate estimate is obtained.\n3. For each item settled on, estimate its protein content in grams.\n4. Add the protein values from all items. Respond with a dictionary object containing the total protein in grams as follows:\n{\"total_protein\": total grams of protein for the meal}\nFor the total protein, respond with just the numeric amount of protein without extra text. If you don't know the answer, set the value of \"total_protein\" to -1.\n\nFollow the format of the following examples when answering:\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- Scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs\n- 1 toast\n2. No carbohydrates provided.\n3. Estimate protein content in grams.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 12.7g protein.\n1 toast has 2.6g protein.\n4.

Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- 61.9g of red palm oil\n- 729g of ready-to-eat maize porridge\n2. Estimate carb contributions per item.\nRed palm oil: Carb content is about 0g per 100g.\nFor 61.9g: 61.9 * 0 = 0g\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: This depends heavily on its water content. A typical maize porridge (thin) has 15g carbs per 100g.\n729g * 0.15 = 109.35 grams.\nTotal estimated: 0 + 109.35 = 109.35g carbs. This is more than 20% below the stated 209 grams.\nAdjustment needed: The maize porridge is likely more concentrated.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 30 grams/100g (closer to stiff ugali consistency).\nTry 729 * 0.286 = 208.5 grams.

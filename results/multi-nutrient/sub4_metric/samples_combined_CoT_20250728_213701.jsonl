Since the jar is 170 grams, we need to scale these values accordingly:\n   - Carbohydrates: (8g * 170/100) = 13.6g\n   - Protein: (3g * 170/100) = 5.1g\n   - Fat: (2g * 170/100) = 3.4g\n   - Energy: (60 kcal * 170/100) = 102 kcal\n\nSo the total nutrients in the meal are:\n- Total carbohydrates: 13.6g\n- Total protein: 5.1g\n- Total fat: 3.4g\n- Total energy: 102 kcal\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"total_carbohydrates\": 13.6,\n  \"total_protein\": 5.1,\n  \"total_fat\": 3.4,\n  \"total_energy\": 102\n}\n```"], "pred": {"carb": 13.6, "fat": 3.4, "energy": 102.0, "protein": 5.1}, "thresholds": {"carb": 7.5, "protein": 2.0, "fat": 2.5, "energy": 50.0}, "percent": false, "result": {"carb": {"acc": true, "mae": 1.120000000000001, "mse": 1.2544000000000022, "answer_rate": true}, "fat": {"acc": true, "mae": 1.5, "mse": 2.25, "answer_rate": true}, "energy": {"acc": true, "mae": 11.900000000000006, "mse": 141.61000000000013, "answer_rate": true}, "protein": {"acc": true, "mae": 1.6299999999999994, "mse": 2.656899999999998, "answer_rate": true}}}

For 18 grams of strawberries:\n   - 100 grams of strawberries has approximately 7.7g carbohydrates, 0.8g protein, 0.3g fat, and 32 kcal.\n   - So, 18 grams of strawberries has (7.7 * 0.18) = 1.386g carbohydrates, (0.8 * 0.18) = 0.144g protein, (0.3 * 0.18) = 0.054g fat, and (32 * 0.18) = 5.76 kcal.\n\nNow, summing up the nutrients from honeydew melon and strawberries (ignoring truffles due to negligible content):\n- Total carbohydrates = 11.375 + 1.386 = 12.761g\n- Total protein = 0.625 + 0.144 = 0.769g\n- Total fat = 0.125 + 0.054 = 0.179g\n- Total energy = 45 + 5.76 = 50.76 kcal\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"total_carbohydrates\": 12.761,\n  \"total_protein\": 0.769,\n  \"total_fat\": 0.179,\n  \"total_energy\": 50.76\n}\n```"], "pred": {"carb": 12.761, "fat": 0.179, "energy": 50.76, "protein": 0.769}, "thresholds": {"carb": 7.5, "protein": 2.0, "fat": 2.5, "energy": 50.0}, "percent": false, "result": {"carb": {"acc": true, "mae": 6.4289999999999985, "mse": 41.33204099999998, "answer_rate": true}, "fat": {"acc": false, "mae": 4.201, "mse": 17.648400999999996, "answer_rate": true}, "energy": {"acc": false, "mae": 66.43, "mse": 4412.944900000001, "answer_rate": true}, "protein": {"acc": true, "mae": 0.9110000000000001, "mse": 0.8299210000000002, "answer_rate": true}}}

Ignore additional information that doesn't relate to the item name and serving size.\n2. For each food or beverage item in the meal, calculate the amount of carbohydrates (grams), protein (grams), fat (grams), and energy (kilocalories) for the specific serving size.\n3. Respond with a dictionary object containing the total nutrients as follows:\n{\n  \"total_carbohydrates\": total grams of carbohydrates,\n  \"total_protein\": total grams of protein,\n  \"total_fat\": total grams of fat,\n  \"total_energy\": total kilocalories\n}\nFor each value, respond with just the numeric amount without extra text.

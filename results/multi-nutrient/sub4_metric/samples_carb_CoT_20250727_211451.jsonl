Traditional Italian white bread (Rosetta): Typically, 100g of white bread has about 49g of carbs. Therefore, 45g has (49 * 45/100) = 22.05g of carbs.\n2. Soft Stracchino cheese: Cheese generally has very low carbs. Stracchino cheese has about 0.5g of carbs per 100g. Therefore, 67.5g has (0.5 * 67.5/100) = 0.34g of carbs.\n3. Small raw onion: 100g of raw onion has about 9g of carbs. Therefore, 1.6g has (9 * 1.6/100) = 0.144g of carbs.\n4. Meat-filled tortellini: 100g of meat-filled tortellini has about 24g of carbs. Therefore, 87.5g has (24 * 87.5/100) = 21g of carbs.\n5. Fresh pear: 100g of pear has about 15g of carbs. Therefore, 118g has (15 * 118/100) = 17.7g of carbs.\n6. Raw potato: 100g of raw potato has about 17g of carbs. Therefore, 147.1g has (17 * 147.1/100) = 25.007g of carbs.\n7. Canned peeled tomatoes: 100g of canned peeled tomatoes has about 4g of carbs. Therefore, 35.5g has (4 * 35.5/100) = 1.42g of carbs.\n8. Olive oil: Olive oil does not contain carbohydrates, so it contributes 0g of carbs.\n\nNow, let's sum up the total carbohydrates:\n\nTotal carbs = 22.05 + 0.34 + 0.144 + 21 + 17.7 + 25.007 + 1.42 + 0 = 87.661\n\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 87.661}"], "pred": 87.661, "threshold": 7.5, "percent": false, "result": {"acc": false, "mae": 19.798999999999978, "mse": 392.00040099999916, "answer_rate": true}}

Boiled coriander leaves: 100g has approximately 3.67g carbs, so 99g has (3.67 * 99 / 100) = 3.63g carbs.\n4. Boiled courgettes: 100g has approximately 3.11g carbs, so 137.1g has (3.11 * 137.1 / 100) = 4.26g carbs.\n5. Drinking water: 500g has 0g carbs.\n6. Boiled garlic: 100g has approximately 33.06g carbs, so 2.7g has (33.06 * 2.7 / 100) = 0.89g carbs.\n7. Clear meat soup: Typically very low in carbs, assume 0g carbs for 49.6g.\n8. Boiled white onions: 100g has approximately 7.64g carbs, so 1.6g has (7.64 * 1.6 / 100) = 0.12g carbs.\n9. Plain uncooked pasta: 100g has approximately 75g carbs, so 6.5g has (75 * 6.5 / 100) = 4.88g carbs.\n10. Boiled plum tomato: 100g has approximately 3.89g carbs, so 5.4g has (3.89 * 5.4 / 100) = 0.21g carbs.\n11. Boiled potatoes: 100g has approximately 17.58g carbs, so 116.5g has (17.58 * 116.5 / 100) = 20.48g carbs.\n12. Salt: 0g carbs.\n13. Boiled spearmint: 100g has approximately 8.41g carbs, so 53.3g has (8.41 * 53.3 / 100) = 4.48g carbs.\n14.

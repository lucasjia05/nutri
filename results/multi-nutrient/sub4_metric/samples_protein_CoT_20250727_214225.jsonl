Fresh chicken breast: Chicken breast has approximately 31g of protein per 100g. Therefore, 28.9g of chicken breast has (31 * 28.9 / 100) = 8.959g of protein.\n\n2. Hen eggs: Eggs have approximately 13g of protein per 100g. Therefore, 14.4g of eggs has (13 * 14.4 / 100) = 1.872g of protein.\n\n3. Olive oil: Olive oil does not contain protein. Therefore, 1.1g of olive oil has 0g of protein.\n\n4. Pre-cooked chicken sausages: Chicken sausages have approximately 12g of protein per 100g. Therefore, 5.7g of chicken sausages has (12 * 5.7 / 100) = 0.684g of protein.\n\n5. Raw rice: Raw rice has approximately 2.7g of protein per 100g. Therefore, 28.9g of raw rice has (2.7 * 28.9 / 100) = 0.7803g of protein.\n\n6. Flavored soft drink: Soft drinks generally do not contain protein. Therefore, 226g of flavored soft drink has 0g of protein.\n\n7. Soy sauce: Soy sauce has approximately 5g of protein per 100g. Therefore, 8.6g of soy sauce has (5 * 8.6 / 100) = 0.43g of protein.\n\n8. Spring onions: Spring onions have approximately 1.8g of protein per 100g. Therefore, 2.0g of spring onions has (1.8 * 2.0 / 100) = 0.036g of protein.\n\n9. Unbottled water: Water does not contain protein.

Whole egg: A standard large egg (about 50g) has approximately 6.3g of protein. Therefore, 75g of whole egg has (6.3 * 75/50) = 9.45g protein.\n3. Sunflower seed oil: Oil does not contain protein, so 0g protein.\n4. Onions: Onions have about 1.1g of protein per 100g, so 13.1g of onions has (1.1 * 13.1/100) = 0.1441g protein.\n5. Peaches: Peaches have about 0.9g of protein per 100g, so 45g of peaches has (0.9 * 45/100) = 0.405g protein.\n6. Red peppers: Red peppers have about 0.9g of protein per 100g, so 16.4g of red peppers has (0.9 * 16.4/100) = 0.1476g protein.\n7. Pineapple juice: Pineapple juice has about 0.4g of protein per 100g, so 200g of pineapple juice has (0.4 * 200/100) = 0.8g protein.\n8. Parsley: Parsley has about 3g of protein per 100g, so 1.8g of parsley has (3 * 1.8/100) = 0.054g protein.\n9. Table salt: Salt does not contain protein, so 0g protein.\n10. Tap water: Water does not contain protein, so 0g protein.\n11. Tomatoes: Tomatoes have about 0.9g of protein per 100g, so 18.8g of tomatoes has (0.9 * 18.8/100) = 0.1692g protein.\n12.

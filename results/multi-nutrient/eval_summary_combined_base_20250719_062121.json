If you don't know the answer for any value, set it to -1.\n\nQuery: \"This morning, I had a cup of oatmeal with half a sliced banana and a glass of orange juice.\"\nAnswer: {\n  \"total_carbohydrates\": 66.5,\n  \"total_protein\": 7.5,\n  \"total_fat\": 6.4,\n  \"total_energy\": 330\n}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: {\n  \"total_carbohydrates\": 15,\n  \"total_protein\": 16,\n  \"total_fat\": 21,\n  \"total_energy\": 320\n}\n\nQuery: \"Half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.\"\nAnswer: {\n  \"total_carbohydrates\": 25.3,\n  \"total_protein\": 6.5,\n  \"total_fat\": 9.8,\n  \"total_energy\": 280\n}",

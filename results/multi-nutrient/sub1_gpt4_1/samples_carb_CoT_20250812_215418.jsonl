This is far above 106.6 kcal, so something is off.\nReconsider oatmeal: 248g may be referring to the entire drink, rather than the amount of dry oatmeal.\n248g of oatmeal drink: Approx. 45 kcal / 100g\n248 * 0.45 kcal / g = 111.6 kcal - acceptable.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nAn oatmeal drink typically has around 10.5g carbs per 100g:\n248g * 0.105 = 26.04g carbs\n4. Add the carbs from all items and return the total as a dictionary.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 1470 kcal.

Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- 61.9g of red palm oil\n- 729g of ready-to-eat maize porridge\n2. Estimate energy contributions per item.\nRed palm oil: Energy content is about 884 kcal per 100g.\nFor 61.9g: 884 * 0.619 = 547 kcal\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: This depends heavily on its water content. A typical maize porridge (thin) has ~50-60 kcal per 100g.\n729g * 0.55 = 400.95 kcal.\nTotal estimated: 547 + 401 = 948 kcal. This is far below the stated 1470 kcal.\nAdjustment needed: Either the maize porridge is more concentrated or oil quantity/energy is wrong.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 160 kcal/100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\nTry 729 * 1.27 = 926.8 kcal. (127 kcal/100g assumption)\nNew total: 547 (oil) + 927 (porridge) \u2248 1474 kcal, matching well. So, we assume maize porridge at 127 kcal/100g.\n3.

Estimate energy contributions per item.\nRed palm oil: Energy content is about 884 kcal per 100g.\nFor 61.9g: 884 * 0.619 = 547 kcal\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: This depends heavily on its water content. A typical maize porridge (thin) has ~50-60 kcal per 100g.\n729g * 0.55 = 400.95 kcal.\nTotal estimated: 547 + 401 = 948 kcal. This is far below the stated 1470 kcal.\nAdjustment needed: Either the maize porridge is more concentrated or oil quantity/energy is wrong.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 160 kcal/100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\nTry 729 * 1.27 = 926.8 kcal. (127 kcal/100g assumption)\nNew total: 547 (oil) + 927 (porridge) \u2248 1474 kcal, matching well. So, we assume maize porridge at 127 kcal/100g.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nRed palm oil: 0g carbs (pure fat)\nMaize porridge: At 127 kcal/100g, and assuming 80% of energy is from carbs:\n127 kcal * 0.90 = 114.3 kcal from carbs\nSo 114.3 / 4 = 28.6g carbs per 100g\nUsing 28.6g/100g as a realistic estimate:\n729g * 0.286 = 208.5g carbs\n4.

Estimate energy contributions per item.\nRed palm oil: Energy content is about 884 kcal per 100g.\nFor 61.9g: 884 * 0.619 = 547 kcal\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: This depends heavily on its water content. A typical maize porridge (thin) has ~50-60 kcal per 100g.\n729g * 0.55 = 400.95 kcal.\nTotal estimated: 547 + 401 = 948 kcal. This is far below the stated 1470 kcal.\nAdjustment needed: Either the maize porridge is more concentrated or oil quantity/energy is wrong.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 160 kcal/100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\nTry 729 * 1.27 = 926.8 kcal. (127 kcal/100g assumption)\nNew total: 547 (oil) + 927 (porridge) \u2248 1474 kcal, matching well. So, we assume maize porridge at 127 kcal/100g.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nRed palm oil: 0g carbs (pure fat)\nMaize porridge: At 127 kcal/100g, and assuming 80% of energy is from carbs:\n127 kcal * 0.90 = 114.3 kcal from carbs\nSo 114.3 / 4 = 28.6g carbs per 100g\nUsing 28.6g/100g as a realistic estimate:\n729g * 0.286 = 208.5g carbs\n4.

A typical maize porridge (thin) has ~50-60 kcal per 100g.\n729g * 0.55 = 400.95 kcal.\nTotal estimated: 547 + 401 = 948 kcal. This is far below the stated 1470 kcal.\nAdjustment needed: Either the maize porridge is more concentrated or oil quantity/energy is wrong.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 160 kcal/100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\nTry 729 * 1.27 = 926.8 kcal.

Estimate energy contributions per item.\nRed palm oil: Energy content is about 884 kcal per 100g.\nFor 61.9g: 884 * 0.619 = 547 kcal\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: This depends heavily on its water content. A typical maize porridge (thin) has ~50-60 kcal per 100g.\n729g * 0.55 = 400.95 kcal.\nTotal estimated: 547 + 401 = 948 kcal. This is far below the stated 1470 kcal.\nAdjustment needed: Either the maize porridge is more concentrated or oil quantity/energy is wrong.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 160 kcal/100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\nTry 729 * 1.27 = 926.8 kcal. (127 kcal/100g assumption)\nNew total: 547 (oil) + 927 (porridge) \u2248 1474 kcal, matching well. So, we assume maize porridge at 127 kcal/100g.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nRed palm oil: 0g carbs (pure fat)\nMaize porridge: At 127 kcal/100g, and assuming 80% of energy is from carbs:\n127 kcal * 0.90 = 114.3 kcal from carbs\nSo 114.3 / 4 = 28.6g carbs per 100g\nUsing 28.6g/100g as a realistic estimate:\n729g * 0.286 = 208.5g carbs\n4.

The largest uncertainty is in the beef balls and stew. If both are richer (more oil), say 250 kcal/100g for beef balls (430 kcal) and 150 kcal/100g for stew (205 kcal), new sum: 430 + 189 + 25 + 205 + 398 = 1247 kcal, closer but still a bit low.

This is far above 106.6 kcal, so something is off.\nReconsider oatmeal: 248g may be referring to the entire drink, rather than the amount of dry oatmeal.\n248g of oatmeal drink: Approx. 45 kcal / 100g\n248 * 0.45 kcal / g = 111.6 kcal - acceptable.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nAn oatmeal drink typically has around 10.5g carbs per 100g:\n248g * 0.105 = 26.04g carbs\n4. Add the carbs from all items and return the total as a dictionary.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 1470 kcal.

Estimate energy contributions per item.\nRed palm oil: Energy content is about 884 kcal per 100g.\nFor 61.9g: 884 * 0.619 = 547 kcal\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: This depends heavily on its water content. A typical maize porridge (thin) has ~50-60 kcal per 100g.\n729g * 0.55 = 400.95 kcal.\nTotal estimated: 547 + 401 = 948 kcal. This is far below the stated 1470 kcal.\nAdjustment needed: Either the maize porridge is more concentrated or oil quantity/energy is wrong.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 160 kcal/100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\nTry 729 * 1.27 = 926.8 kcal. (127 kcal/100g assumption)\nNew total: 547 (oil) + 927 (porridge) \u2248 1474 kcal, matching well. So, we assume maize porridge at 127 kcal/100g.\n3.

Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- 248g of boiled coffee beans and salt\n- 290g of corn bread\n- 210.2g of Ethiopian kale cooked with oil and onion\n\n2. Estimate energy contributions per item.\nTotal energy: 622 kcal\n\nFirst, estimate typical energy per item:\n- Boiled coffee beans and salt: Coffee beans are not typically eaten in large quantities; if boiled, much of the mass is water. 248g is likely the weight of the boiled mixture, not dry beans. Boiled coffee beans (edible portion) are about 330 kcal/100g dry, but boiled, much less. Let's assume 10g dry beans per 100g boiled, so 24.8g dry beans: 24.8g * 3.3 = 81.8 kcal.\n- Corn bread: 290g is a large serving. Typical cornbread is ~250 kcal/100g. 290g * 2.5 = 725 kcal. This is already above the total meal kcal, so the cornbread must be much less dense or diluted.\n- Ethiopian kale cooked with oil and onion: 210.2g. Cooked kale is about 30 kcal/100g, but with oil and onion, could be 60 kcal/100g. 210.2g * 0.6 = 126 kcal.\n\nSum: 81.8 (coffee beans) + 725 (cornbread) + 126 (kale) = 932.8 kcal, much higher than 622 kcal.\n\nReconsider cornbread: If it's a very light, low-fat, low-sugar version, maybe 100 kcal/100g. 290g * 1 = 290 kcal.\nNew sum: 81.8 + 290 + 126 = 497.8 kcal, still below 622 kcal.\n\nReconsider kale: If more oil is used, maybe 100 kcal/100g. 210.2g * 1 = 210 kcal.\nNew sum: 81.8 + 290 + 210 = 581.8 kcal.\n\nReconsider coffee beans: If more dry beans are used, say 20g per 100g boiled, 49.6g dry beans: 49.6 * 3.3 = 163.7 kcal.\nNew sum: 163.7 + 290 + 210 = 663.7 kcal, close to 622 kcal.\n\nSo, let's settle on:\n- Boiled coffee beans (49.6g dry): 163.7 kcal\n- Corn bread (290g, 100 kcal/100g): 290 kcal\n- Ethiopian kale (210.2g, 100 kcal/100g): 210 kcal\n\n3.

Estimate energy contributions per item.\nRed palm oil: Energy content is about 884 kcal per 100g.\nFor 61.9g: 884 * 0.619 = 547 kcal\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: This depends heavily on its water content. A typical maize porridge (thin) has ~50-60 kcal per 100g.\n729g * 0.55 = 400.95 kcal.\nTotal estimated: 547 + 401 = 948 kcal. This is far below the stated 1470 kcal.\nAdjustment needed: Either the maize porridge is more concentrated or oil quantity/energy is wrong.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 160 kcal/100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\nTry 729 * 1.27 = 926.8 kcal. (127 kcal/100g assumption)\nNew total: 547 (oil) + 927 (porridge) \u2248 1474 kcal, matching well. So, we assume maize porridge at 127 kcal/100g.\n3.

Estimate energy contributions per item.\nRed palm oil: Energy content is about 884 kcal per 100g.\nFor 61.9g: 884 * 0.619 = 547 kcal\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: This depends heavily on its water content. A typical maize porridge (thin) has ~50-60 kcal per 100g.\n729g * 0.55 = 400.95 kcal.\nTotal estimated: 547 + 401 = 948 kcal. This is far below the stated 1470 kcal.\nAdjustment needed: Either the maize porridge is more concentrated or oil quantity/energy is wrong.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 160 kcal/100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\nTry 729 * 1.27 = 926.8 kcal. (127 kcal/100g assumption)\nNew total: 547 (oil) + 927 (porridge) \u2248 1474 kcal, matching well. So, we assume maize porridge at 127 kcal/100g.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nRed palm oil: 0g carbs (pure fat)\nMaize porridge: At 127 kcal/100g, and assuming 80% of energy is from carbs:\n127 kcal * 0.90 = 114.3 kcal from carbs\nSo 114.3 / 4 = 28.6g carbs per 100g\nUsing 28.6g/100g as a realistic estimate:\n729g * 0.286 = 208.5g carbs\n4.

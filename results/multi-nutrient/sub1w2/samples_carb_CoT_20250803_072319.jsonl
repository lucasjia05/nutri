Assuming about 6 grams of carbohydrates per 100 grams, 34.5 grams would contribute approximately 2.07 grams of carbohydrates.\n\n2. **Solid Jaggery (14 grams)**:\n   - Jaggery is high in carbohydrates, primarily sugars. It contains about 98 grams of carbohydrates per 100 grams. Therefore, 14 grams would contribute approximately 13.72 grams of carbohydrates.\n\n3. **Milk Tea (72.1 grams)**:\n   - Milk tea contains milk and sugar. Assuming a typical milk tea with about 10 grams of carbohydrates per 100 grams, 72.1 grams would contribute approximately 7.21 grams of carbohydrates.\n\n4. **Raw Peanuts (40 grams)**:\n   - Peanuts are relatively low in carbohydrates. They contain about 16 grams of carbohydrates per 100 grams. Therefore, 40 grams would contribute approximately 6.4 grams of carbohydrates.\n\n5. **Potato Bhaji (111 grams)**:\n   - Potato bhaji is primarily made of potatoes, which are high in carbohydrates. Assuming about 17 grams of carbohydrates per 100 grams, 111 grams would contribute approximately 18.87 grams of carbohydrates.\n\n6. **Puri (33.1 grams)**:\n   - Puri is a deep-fried bread made from wheat flour, which is high in carbohydrates.

Therefore, 178 grams would contain approximately \\( 178 \\times 0.38 = 67.64 \\) grams of carbohydrates.\n\n2. **Dried starchy roots and tuber products (5.2 grams):** These are typically high in carbohydrates. Assuming a carbohydrate content of about 80% (common for dried starchy products), 5.2 grams would contain approximately \\( 5.2 \\times 0.8 = 4.16 \\) grams of carbohydrates.\n\n3. **Roasted pumpkin seeds (71.8 grams):** Pumpkin seeds are lower in carbohydrates, with about 15 grams of carbohydrates per 100 grams.

Estimate energy contributions per item.\n248g of oatmeal: Approx. 70 kcal / 100g\n248g * 0.7 kcal/g = 173.6 kcal. This is far above 106.6 kcal, so something is off.\nReconsider oatmeal: 248g may be referring to the entire drink, rather than the amount of dry oatmeal.\n248g of oatmeal drink: Approx. 45 kcal / 100g\n248 * 0.45 kcal/g = 111.6 kcal - acceptable.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nAn oatmeal drink typically has around 10.5g carbs per 100g:\n248g * 0.105 = 26.04g carbs\n4.

Estimate energy contributions per item.\nRed palm oil: Energy content is about 884 kcal per 100g.\nFor 61.9g: 884 * 0.619 = 547 kcal\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: This depends heavily on its water content. A typical maize porridge (thin) has ~50-60 kcal per 100g.\n729g * 0.55 = 400.95 kcal\nTotal estimated: 547 + 401 = 948 kcal. This is far below the stated 1470 kcal.\nAdjustment needed: Either the maize porridge is more concentrated or oil quantity/energy is wrong.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 160 kcal/100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\nTry 729 * 1.27 = 926.8 kcal (127 kcal/100g assumption)\nNew total: 547 (oil) + 927 (porridge) \u2248 1474 kcal, matching well. So, we assume maize porridge at 127 kcal/100g.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nRed palm oil: 0g carbs (pure fat)\nMaize porridge: At 127 kcal/100g, and assuming 80% of energy is from carbs:\n127 kcal * 0.90 = 114.3 kcal from carbs\nSo 114.3 / 4 = 28.6g carbs per 100g\nUsing 28.6g/100g as a realistic estimate:\n729g * 0.286 = 208.5g carbs\n4.

The meal consists of:\n- A drink made from 248g of oatmeal and water\nThis is best characterized as a Western meal.\n2. Estimate energy contributions per item.\n248g of oatmeal: Approx. 70 kcal / 100g\n248g * 0.7 kcal/g = 173.6 kcal. This is far above 106.6 kcal, so something is off.\nReconsider oatmeal: 248g may be referring to the entire drink, rather than the amount of dry oatmeal.\n248g of oatmeal drink: Approx. 45 kcal / 100g\n248 * 0.45 kcal/g = 111.6 kcal - acceptable.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nAn oatmeal drink typically has around 10.5g carbs per 100g:\n248g * 0.105 = 26.04g carbs\n4.

This is far below the stated 1470 kcal.\nAdjustment needed: Either the maize porridge is more concentrated or oil quantity/energy is wrong.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 160 kcal/100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\nTry 729 * 1.27 = 926.8 kcal (127 kcal/100g assumption)\nNew total: 547 (oil) + 927 (porridge) \u2248 1474 kcal, matching well.

A typical maize porridge (thin) has ~50-60 kcal per 100g.\n729g * 0.55 = 400.95 kcal\nTotal estimated: 547 + 401 = 948 kcal. This is far below the stated 1470 kcal.\nAdjustment needed: Either the maize porridge is more concentrated or oil quantity/energy is wrong.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 160 kcal/100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\nTry 729 * 1.27 = 926.8 kcal (127 kcal/100g assumption)\nNew total: 547 (oil) + 927 (porridge) \u2248 1474 kcal, matching well.

A typical maize porridge (thin) has ~50-60 kcal per 100g.\n729g * 0.55 = 400.95 kcal\nTotal estimated: 547 + 401 = 948 kcal. This is far below the stated 1470 kcal.\nAdjustment needed: Either the maize porridge is more concentrated or oil quantity/energy is wrong.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 160 kcal/100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\nTry 729 * 1.27 = 926.8 kcal (127 kcal/100g assumption)\nNew total: 547 (oil) + 927 (porridge) \u2248 1474 kcal, matching well.

Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size. If no size is given, assume one standard serving based on common guidelines. Based on these items, classify the meal's regional context by determining whether it is best characterized as primarily Western (e.g., U.S./European) or non-Western/traditional (e.g., African, Asian, Latin American). Use USDA food composition data for Western meals, and FAO/WHO or local sources for non-Western/traditional meals.\n2. If total energy (kcal) is provided, estimate the amount of energy each item contributes to the total. If the total energy estimated differs by more than 20%, reconsider the assumed form of every single relevant item (e.g., concentration, dry vs. wet vs. dehydrated). Repeat this step until a consistent energy estimate is obtained.\n3. For each item settled on, estimate its carbohydrate content in grams.\n4. Add the carbohydrates from all items. Respond with a dictionary object containing the total carbohydrates in grams as follows:\n{\"total_carbohydrates\": total grams of carbohydrates for the meal}\nFor the total carbohydrates, respond with just the numeric amount of carbohydrates without extra text. If you don't know the answer, set the value of \"total_carbohydrates\" to -1.\n\nFollow the format of the following examples when answering:\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. The meal consists of:\n- Scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs\n- 1 toast\nThis is best characterized as a Western meal.\n2. No energy provided.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs. 1 toast has 13g carbs.\n4. Add carbohydrate values.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 106.6 kcal. I've got a drink made from 248 grams of oatmeal and water for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. The meal consists of:\n- A drink made from 248g of oatmeal and water\nThis is best characterized as a Western meal.\n2. Estimate energy contributions per item.\n248g of oatmeal: Approx. 70 kcal / 100g\n248g * 0.7 kcal/g = 173.6 kcal. This is far above 106.6 kcal, so something is off.\nReconsider oatmeal: 248g may be referring to the entire drink, rather than the amount of dry oatmeal.\n248g of oatmeal drink: Approx. 45 kcal / 100g\n248 * 0.45 kcal/g = 111.6 kcal - acceptable.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nAn oatmeal drink typically has around 10.5g carbs per 100g:\n248g * 0.105 = 26.04g carbs\n4. Add the carbs from all items and return the total as a dictionary.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 1470 kcal. For breakfast, I had 61.9g of red palm oil and 729.0g of ready-to-eat maize porridge.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- 61.9g of red palm oil\n- 729g of ready-to-eat maize porridge\nThis is best characterized as a non-Western/traditional meal, likely African in context, based on the ingredients (e.g., palm oil, maize porridge).\n2. Estimate energy contributions per item.\nRed palm oil: Energy content is about 884 kcal per 100g.\nFor 61.9g: 884 * 0.619 = 547 kcal\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: This depends heavily on its water content. A typical maize porridge (thin) has ~50-60 kcal per 100g.\n729g * 0.55 = 400.95 kcal\nTotal estimated: 547 + 401 = 948 kcal. This is far below the stated 1470 kcal.\nAdjustment needed: Either the maize porridge is more concentrated or oil quantity/energy is wrong.\nLet's assume a thicker maize porridge or less water content. Dense cooked maize porridge can have up to 160 kcal/100g (closer to stiff ugali or polenta consistency).\nTry 729 * 1.27 = 926.8 kcal (127 kcal/100g assumption)\nNew total: 547 (oil) + 927 (porridge) \u2248 1474 kcal, matching well. So, we assume maize porridge at 127 kcal/100g.\n3.

Estimate energy contributions per item.\nRed palm oil: Energy content is about 884 kcal per 100g.\nFor 61.9g: 884 * 0.619 = 547 kcal\nReady-to-eat maize porridge: This depends heavily on its water content.

This is significantly below the stated 535 kcal. The patty might be more energy-dense than assumed, or there might be additional ingredients contributing to the energy content.\n\nLet's adjust the patty to account for the difference. If the total should be 535 kcal, then the patty should contribute more energy:\n535 - (13.68 + 50 + 19.35) = 451.97 kcal for the patty.\nThis suggests the patty is approximately 376.64 kcal per 100g, which is plausible for a rich, curd-filled pastry.\n\n3.

Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nRed palm oil: 0g carbs (pure fat)\nMaize porridge: At 127 kcal/100g, and assuming 80% of energy is from carbs:\n127 kcal * 0.90 = 114.3 kcal from carbs\nSo 114.3 / 4 = 28.6g carbs per 100g\nUsing 28.6g/100g as a realistic estimate:\n729g * 0.286 = 208.5g carbs\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 208.5}", "query": "The following meal contains 265.0 kcal.

Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- 1g of baking yeast\n- 24g of boiled kapok flowers\n- 63g of millet flour (dried and boiled with husks)\n- 1g of paprika powder\n- 2g of iodised salt\n- 2g of fermented stink beans (boiled)\n- 1g of stock cubes\n\nThis is best characterized as a non-Western/traditional meal, likely African or Asian in context, based on the ingredients (e.g., kapok flowers, millet flour, stink beans).\n\n2. Estimate energy contributions per item.\n- Baking yeast: Minimal energy contribution, typically around 325 kcal/100g. For 1g: 3.25 kcal.\n- Boiled kapok flowers: Minimal energy, typically low in calories. Assume around 20 kcal/100g. For 24g: 4.8 kcal.\n- Millet flour (dried and boiled with husks): Approx. 360 kcal/100g for dry millet flour. For 63g: 226.8 kcal.\n- Paprika powder: Minimal energy, around 282 kcal/100g. For 1g: 2.82 kcal.\n- Iodised salt: 0 kcal.\n- Fermented stink beans (boiled): Minimal energy, assume around 100 kcal/100g. For 2g: 2 kcal.\n- Stock cubes: Minimal energy, around 250 kcal/100g. For 1g: 2.5 kcal.\n\nTotal estimated energy: 3.25 + 4.8 + 226.8 + 2.82 + 0 + 2 + 2.5 = 242.17 kcal. This is slightly below the stated 265 kcal, but within a reasonable range considering potential variations in ingredient energy content.\n\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\n- Baking yeast: Minimal carbs, around 0.5g per 1g.\n- Boiled kapok flowers: Minimal carbs, assume around 0.5g per 24g.\n- Millet flour: High in carbs, around 72g per 100g. For 63g: 45.36g.\n- Paprika powder: Minimal carbs, around 0.5g per 1g.\n- Iodised salt: 0g carbs.\n- Fermented stink beans: Minimal carbs, assume around 0.5g per 2g.\n- Stock cubes: Minimal carbs, around 0.5g per 1g.\n\n4.

Therefore, 19.5g of red palm oil contains 0g of carbohydrates.\n\n4. **Salt**: Salt contains no carbohydrates. Therefore, 1.9g of salt contains 0g of carbohydrates.\n\n5. **Boiled sweet potato leaves**: Sweet potato leaves are low in carbohydrates.

Dry red peppers: 0.3g is negligible in terms of carbs, so we can consider it as 0g of carbs.\n5. Flour: 100g of flour has about 76g of carbs. Therefore, 0.7g has (76 * 0.007) = 0.532g of carbs.\n6. Sunflower oil: Oil does not contain carbs, so 0g of carbs.\n7. Diced spring onions: 100g of spring onions have about 7g of carbs. Therefore, 8.4g has (7 * 0.084) = 0.588g of carbs.\n8. Chopped green peppers: 100g of green peppers have about 6g of carbs. Therefore, 5g has (6 * 0.05) = 0.3g of carbs.\n9. Parsley: 1.2g is negligible in terms of carbs, so we can consider it as 0g of carbs.\n10. Table salt: Salt does not contain carbs, so 0g of carbs.\n11.

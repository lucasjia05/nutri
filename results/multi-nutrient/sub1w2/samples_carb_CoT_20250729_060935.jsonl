But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 29.76}\n\nQuery: \"Half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of 1/2 a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.\n1 full sandwich has 50.6g carbs, so half has 50.6 * 0.5 = 25.3g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 25.3}", "query": "The following meal contains 480.9 kcal.

So, 12g of onions has 12 * (9.3 / 100) = 1.116g of carbs.\n5. **Polished rice**: Cooked white rice has about 28g of carbs per 100g. So, 50g of rice has 50 * (28 / 100) = 14g of carbs.\n6. **Stock cubes**: Typically, stock cubes have negligible carbohydrates, so we can assume 0g of carbs.\n7. **Raw green sweet peppers**: Green peppers have about 4.6g of carbs per 100g. So, 9g of peppers has 9 * (4.6 / 100) = 0.414g of carbs.\n8. **Fresh tomatoes**: Tomatoes have about 3.9g of carbs per 100g. So, 45g of tomatoes has 45 * (3.9 / 100) = 1.755g of carbs.\n\nNow, let's add up the carbohydrates:\n\nTotal carbohydrates = 42.4 + 0 + 14.3 + 1.116 + 14 + 0 + 0.414 + 1.755 = 73.985g\n\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 73.985}"], "pred": 73.985, "threshold": 7.5, "percent": false, "result": {"acc": false, "mae": 28.765, "mse": 827.4252250000001, "answer_rate": true}}

We'll assume 0g carbs.\n2. **Boiled kapok flowers (24g):** Kapok flowers are not a common food item, but they are likely to have low carbohydrate content. We'll assume a negligible amount, approximately 0g carbs.\n3. **Millet flour (63g):** Millet flour is high in carbohydrates. It contains about 73g of carbs per 100g. Therefore, 63g of millet flour has approximately (63 * 73 / 100) = 45.99g carbs.\n4. **Paprika powder (1g):** Contains about 54g of carbs per 100g. Therefore, 1g has approximately 0.54g carbs.\n5. **Iodised salt (2g):** Contains 0g carbs.\n6. **Fermented stink beans (2g):** These are likely to have negligible carbohydrates. We'll assume 0g carbs.\n7. **Stock cubes (1g):** Typically contain negligible carbohydrates per gram. We'll assume 0g carbs.\n\nAdding up the carbohydrates:\n- Baking yeast: 0g\n- Boiled kapok flowers: 0g\n- Millet flour: 45.99g\n- Paprika powder: 0.54g\n- Iodised salt: 0g\n- Fermented stink beans: 0g\n- Stock cubes: 0g\n\nTotal carbohydrates = 45.99 + 0.54 = 46.53g\n\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 46.53}"], "pred": 46.53, "threshold": 7.5, "percent": false, "result": {"acc": true, "mae": 2.969999999999999, "mse": 8.820899999999993, "answer_rate": true}}

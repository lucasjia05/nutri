But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\nThis exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: Reduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal.

But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\nThis exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: Reduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal.

But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\nThis exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: Reduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal.

But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\nThis exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: Reduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal.

But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\nThis exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: Reduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal.

But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\nThis exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: Reduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal.

I've got a drink made from 248 grams of oatmeal and water for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of a drink made from 248g of oatmeal and water.\nWithout context, 248g could refer to dry oatmeal. But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\nThis exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: Reduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal.

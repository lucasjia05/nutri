    "prompt": "For the given query including a meal description, think step by step as follows:\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size. If no size is given, assume one standard serving based on common guidelines (e.g., USDA).\n2. If total energy (kcal) is provided, use it to consider multiple plausible forms of each item (e.g. thick vs. thin porridge, dry vs cooked oatmeal) and choose the one most consistent with the total kcal.\n3. For each item, estimate its carbohydrate content in grams.\n4. Add the carbohydrates from all items. Respond with a dictionary object containing the total carbohydrates in grams as follows:\n{\"total_carbohydrates\": total grams of carbohydrates for the meal}\nFor the total carbohydrates, respond with just the numeric amount of carbohydrates without extra text. If you don't know the answer, set the value of \"total_carbohydrates\" to -1.\n\nFollow the format of the following examples when answering:\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. The meal consists of:\n- Scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs\n- 1 toast\n2. No energy provided.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs. 1 toast has 13g carbs.\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 106.6 kcal. I've got a drink made from 248 grams of oatmeal and water for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- A drink made from 248g of oatmeal and water\nThe total energy content is 106.6 kcal.\n2. Use total energy (106.6 kcal) to guide assumptions.\n248g of dry oats would contain far more than 900 kcal, so this must refer to a very diluted mixture\u2014either cooked oatmeal or an oat-based drink.\nThis energy density = 106.6 kcal / 248g \u2248 0.43 kcal/g, indicating a highly water-diluted product.\nThis is consistent with an oat drink.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nCooked oatmeal (or a thin oat drink) typically has around 10-12g carbs per 100g.\nUsing a conservative mid-range value of 10.5g/100g:\n248g * 0.105 = 26.04g carbs\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 1470 kcal. For breakfast, I had 61.9g of red palm oil and 729.0g of ready-to-eat maize porridge.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- 61.9g of red palm oil\n- 729g of ready-to-eat maize porridge\nThe total energy content is 1470 kcal.\n2. Use total energy (1470 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nPalm oil has 0g carbohydrates and is almost entirely fat (~9 kcal/g), so:\n61.9g * 9 = 557.1 kcal from fat\nThat leaves 1470 - 557.1 = 912.9 kcal from the porridge.\nEnergy density of the porridge = 912.9 kcal / 729g \u2248 1.25 kcal/g, indicating a thicker porridge (not watery).\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nThicker maize porridges can have 25-30g of carbs per 100g.\nUsing 28.4g/100g as a realistic estimate:\n729g * 0.284 = 207.04g carbs\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 207.04}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal. Tonight's dinner is 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood\nThe total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n2. Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nEstimated total carbs = 39 + 3.1 = 42.1 g.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 42.1}\n",

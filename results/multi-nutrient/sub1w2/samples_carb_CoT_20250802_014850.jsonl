The total energy content is 106.6 kcal.\nWithout context, 248g could refer to dry oatmeal. But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal.

But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal. Tonight's dinner is 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood. The total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood typically contains about 30g of carbohydrates per 100g.\nTherefore, 250g would contain (30 * 2.5) = 75g of carbohydrates.\nConsistency check: \n- 75g carbs * 4kcal/g = 300 kcal. That leaves only 83.8 kcal for all fat and protein in a 383.8 kcal meal, which is unlikely given the presence of cream sauce, seafood, and poultry \u2014 all rich in fat and protein. \n- So, the assumed carb density is likely too high. \nRevised estimate: \nA more realistic estimate would use 16.5g of carbs per 100g, accounting for more calories from fat and protein.\n250 * 0.165 = 41.25g carbs.

But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal. Tonight's dinner is 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood. The total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood typically contains about 30g of carbohydrates per 100g.\nTherefore, 250g would contain (30 * 2.5) = 75g of carbohydrates.\nConsistency check: \n- 75g carbs * 4kcal/g = 300 kcal. That leaves only 83.8 kcal for all fat and protein in a 383.8 kcal meal, which is unlikely given the presence of cream sauce, seafood, and poultry \u2014 all rich in fat and protein. \n- So, the assumed carb density is likely too high. \nRevised estimate: \nA more realistic estimate would use 16.5g of carbs per 100g, accounting for more calories from fat and protein.\n250 * 0.165 = 41.25g carbs.

That leaves only 83.8 kcal for all fat and protein in a 383.8 kcal meal, which is unlikely given the presence of cream sauce, seafood, and poultry \u2014 all rich in fat and protein. \n- So, the assumed carb density is likely too high. \nRevised estimate: \nA more realistic estimate would use 16.5g of carbs per 100g, accounting for more calories from fat and protein.\n250 * 0.165 = 41.25g carbs. This leaves 383.8 kcal - (41.25g * 4kcal/g) = 218.3 kcal coming from fat and protein which is reasonable.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 41.25}\n\nQuery: \"Half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of 1/2 a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.\n1 full sandwich has 50.6g carbs, so half has 50.6 * 0.5 = 25.3g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 25.3}", "query": "The following meal contains 205.84 kcal.

The total energy content is 106.6 kcal.\nWithout context, 248g could refer to dry oatmeal. But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal.

But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal. Tonight's dinner is 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood. The total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood typically contains about 30g of carbohydrates per 100g.\nTherefore, 250g would contain (30 * 2.5) = 75g of carbohydrates.\nConsistency check: \n- 75g carbs * 4kcal/g = 300 kcal.

But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal. Tonight's dinner is 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood. The total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood typically contains about 30g of carbohydrates per 100g.\nTherefore, 250g would contain (30 * 2.5) = 75g of carbohydrates.\nConsistency check: \n- 75g carbs * 4kcal/g = 300 kcal.

But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal.

The total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood typically contains about 30g of carbohydrates per 100g.\nTherefore, 250g would contain (30 * 2.5) = 75g of carbohydrates.\nConsistency check: \n- 75g carbs * 4kcal/g = 300 kcal.

But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal. Tonight's dinner is 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood. The total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood typically contains about 30g of carbohydrates per 100g.\nTherefore, 250g would contain (30 * 2.5) = 75g of carbohydrates.\nConsistency check: \n- 75g carbs * 4kcal/g = 300 kcal.

That leaves only 83.8 kcal for all fat and protein in a 383.8 kcal meal, which is unlikely given the presence of cream sauce, seafood, and poultry \u2014 all rich in fat and protein. \n- So, the assumed carb density is likely too high. \nRevised estimate: \nA more realistic estimate would use 16.5g of carbs per 100g, accounting for more calories from fat and protein.\n250 * 0.165 = 41.25g carbs.

But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal. Tonight's dinner is 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood. The total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood typically contains about 30g of carbohydrates per 100g.\nTherefore, 250g would contain (30 * 2.5) = 75g of carbohydrates.\nConsistency check: \n- 75g carbs * 4kcal/g = 300 kcal.

But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal. Tonight's dinner is 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood. The total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood typically contains about 30g of carbohydrates per 100g.\nTherefore, 250g would contain (30 * 2.5) = 75g of carbohydrates.\nConsistency check: \n- 75g carbs * 4kcal/g = 300 kcal.

But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal.

The total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood typically contains about 30g of carbohydrates per 100g.\nTherefore, 250g would contain (30 * 2.5) = 75g of carbohydrates.\nConsistency check: \n- 75g carbs * 4kcal/g = 300 kcal.

But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal. Tonight's dinner is 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood. The total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood typically contains about 30g of carbohydrates per 100g.\nTherefore, 250g would contain (30 * 2.5) = 75g of carbohydrates.\nConsistency check: \n- 75g carbs * 4kcal/g = 300 kcal. That leaves only 83.8 kcal for all fat and protein in a 383.8 kcal meal, which is unlikely given the presence of cream sauce, seafood, and poultry \u2014 all rich in fat and protein. \n- So, the assumed carb density is likely too high. \nRevised estimate: \nA more realistic estimate would use 16.5g of carbs per 100g, accounting for more calories from fat and protein.\n250 * 0.165 = 41.25g carbs.

The total energy content is 106.6 kcal.\nWithout context, 248g could refer to dry oatmeal. But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal.

But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal. Tonight's dinner is 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood. The total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood typically contains about 30g of carbohydrates per 100g.\nTherefore, 250g would contain (30 * 2.5) = 75g of carbohydrates.\nConsistency check: \n- 75g carbs * 4kcal/g = 300 kcal. That leaves only 83.8 kcal for all fat and protein in a 383.8 kcal meal, which is unlikely given the presence of cream sauce, seafood, and poultry \u2014 all rich in fat and protein. \n- So, the assumed carb density is likely too high. \nRevised estimate: \nA more realistic estimate would use 16.5g of carbs per 100g, accounting for more calories from fat and protein.\n250 * 0.165 = 41.25g carbs.

But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal.

But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal. Tonight's dinner is 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood. The total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood typically contains about 30g of carbohydrates per 100g.\nTherefore, 250g would contain (30 * 2.5) = 75g of carbohydrates.\nConsistency check: \n- 75g carbs * 4kcal/g = 300 kcal. That leaves only 83.8 kcal for all fat and protein in a 383.8 kcal meal, which is unlikely given the presence of cream sauce, seafood, and poultry \u2014 all rich in fat and protein. \n- So, the assumed carb density is likely too high. \nRevised estimate: \nA more realistic estimate would use 16.5g of carbs per 100g, accounting for more calories from fat and protein.\n250 * 0.165 = 41.25g carbs.

But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal. Tonight's dinner is 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood. The total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood typically contains about 30g of carbohydrates per 100g.\nTherefore, 250g would contain (30 * 2.5) = 75g of carbohydrates.\nConsistency check: \n- 75g carbs * 4kcal/g = 300 kcal.

But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal. Tonight's dinner is 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood. The total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood typically contains about 30g of carbohydrates per 100g.\nTherefore, 250g would contain (30 * 2.5) = 75g of carbohydrates.\nConsistency check: \n- 75g carbs * 4kcal/g = 300 kcal. That leaves only 83.8 kcal for all fat and protein in a 383.8 kcal meal, which is unlikely given the presence of cream sauce, seafood, and poultry \u2014 all rich in fat and protein. \n- So, the assumed carb density is likely too high. \nRevised estimate: \nA more realistic estimate would use 16.5g of carbs per 100g, accounting for more calories from fat and protein.\n250 * 0.165 = 41.25g carbs.

The total energy content is 106.6 kcal.\nWithout context, 248g could refer to dry oatmeal. But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal.

But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal. Tonight's dinner is 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood. The total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood typically contains about 30g of carbohydrates per 100g.\nTherefore, 250g would contain (30 * 2.5) = 75g of carbohydrates.\nConsistency check: \n- 75g carbs * 4kcal/g = 300 kcal.

But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal.

The total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood typically contains about 30g of carbohydrates per 100g.\nTherefore, 250g would contain (30 * 2.5) = 75g of carbohydrates.\nConsistency check: \n- 75g carbs * 4kcal/g = 300 kcal.

But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal.

The total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood typically contains about 30g of carbohydrates per 100g.\nTherefore, 250g would contain (30 * 2.5) = 75g of carbohydrates.\nConsistency check: \n- 75g carbs * 4kcal/g = 300 kcal.

I've got a drink made from 248 grams of oatmeal and water for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of a drink made from 248g of oatmeal and water. The total energy content is 106.6 kcal.\nWithout context, 248g could refer to dry oatmeal. But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal. Tonight's dinner is 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood. The total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood typically contains about 30g of carbohydrates per 100g.\nTherefore, 250g would contain (30 * 2.5) = 75g of carbohydrates.\nConsistency check: \n- 75g carbs * 4kcal/g = 300 kcal. That leaves only 83.8 kcal for all fat and protein in a 383.8 kcal meal, which is unlikely given the presence of cream sauce, seafood, and poultry \u2014 all rich in fat and protein. \n- So, the assumed carb density is likely too high. \nRevised estimate: \nA more realistic estimate would use 16.5g of carbs per 100g, accounting for more calories from fat and protein.\n250 * 0.165 = 41.25g carbs.

The tostada shell itself is the primary source of carbohydrates.\n   - Assuming the tostada shell contributes about 50% of the weight, that's approximately 30.1g of tostada shell.\n   - A typical tostada shell has about 60g of carbs per 100g.\n   - Therefore, 30.1g of tostada shell would contain approximately 30.1 * 0.6 = 18.06g of carbohydrates.\n\n2. **Carbonated Soft Drink:**\n   - A 355g (or ml) carbonated soft drink typically contains about 10g of carbohydrates per 100g.\n   - Therefore, 355g would contain 355 * 0.1 = 35.5g of carbohydrates.\n\n3. **Total Carbohydrates:**\n   - Tostada: 18.06g\n   - Soft Drink: 35.5g\n   - Total = 18.06 + 35.5 = 53.56g\n\n**Consistency Check:**\n- 53.56g of carbohydrates * 4 kcal/g = 214.24 kcal from carbohydrates alone.\n- This exceeds the stated total energy content of 212.0 kcal, suggesting the carbohydrate content may be slightly overestimated, or the serving sizes or assumptions about the food forms may need adjustment.\n\nRevised estimate:\n- Adjust the carbohydrate content of the tostada shell to better reflect the total energy.\n- Assume the tostada shell contributes 15g of carbohydrates instead of 18.06g.\n\nRevised Total Carbohydrates:\n- Tostada: 15g\n- Soft Drink: 35.5g\n- Total = 15 + 35.5 = 50.5g\n\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 50.5}"], "pred": 50.5, "threshold": 7.5, "percent": false, "result": {"acc": false, "mae": 9.689999999999998, "mse": 93.89609999999996, "answer_rate": true}}

The total energy content is 106.6 kcal.\nWithout context, 248g could refer to dry oatmeal. But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal.

That leaves only 83.8 kcal for all fat and protein in a 383.8 kcal meal, which is unlikely given the presence of cream sauce, seafood, and poultry \u2014 all rich in fat and protein. \n- So, the assumed carb density is likely too high. \nRevised estimate: \nA more realistic estimate would use 16.5g of carbs per 100g, accounting for more calories from fat and protein.\n250 * 0.165 = 41.25g carbs. This leaves 383.8 kcal - (41.25g * 4kcal/g) = 218.3 kcal coming from fat and protein which is reasonable.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 41.25}\n\nQuery: \"Half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of 1/2 a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.\n1 full sandwich has 50.6g carbs, so half has 50.6 * 0.5 = 25.3g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 25.3}", "query": "The following meal contains 850.0 kcal.

But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal. Tonight's dinner is 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood. The total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood typically contains about 30g of carbohydrates per 100g.\nTherefore, 250g would contain (30 * 2.5) = 75g of carbohydrates.\nConsistency check: \n- 75g carbs * 4kcal/g = 300 kcal.

But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal.

The total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood typically contains about 30g of carbohydrates per 100g.\nTherefore, 250g would contain (30 * 2.5) = 75g of carbohydrates.\nConsistency check: \n- 75g carbs * 4kcal/g = 300 kcal.

But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal. Tonight's dinner is 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood. The total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood typically contains about 30g of carbohydrates per 100g.\nTherefore, 250g would contain (30 * 2.5) = 75g of carbohydrates.\nConsistency check: \n- 75g carbs * 4kcal/g = 300 kcal. That leaves only 83.8 kcal for all fat and protein in a 383.8 kcal meal, which is unlikely given the presence of cream sauce, seafood, and poultry \u2014 all rich in fat and protein. \n- So, the assumed carb density is likely too high. \nRevised estimate: \nA more realistic estimate would use 16.5g of carbs per 100g, accounting for more calories from fat and protein.\n250 * 0.165 = 41.25g carbs.

The total energy content is 106.6 kcal.\nWithout context, 248g could refer to dry oatmeal. But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal.

The total energy content is 106.6 kcal.\nWithout context, 248g could refer to dry oatmeal. But the total energy (106.6 kcal) is far too low for that \u2014 248g of dry oatmeal would be over 900 kcal.\nSo it's more likely that this refers to cooked oatmeal, which has about 12g of carbs per 100g.\n248g * (12 / 100) = 29.76g carbs\nWater contributes 0g carbs.\nConsistency check: \n- 29.76g carbs * 4 kcal/g = 119.04 kcal.\n- This exceeds the stated energy (106.6 kcal), which suggests the carb content may be slightly overestimated.\nRevised estimate: \nReduce the carb content of oatmeal slightly \u2014 use 10.5g carbs per 100g to better reflect the total energy.\n248g (10.5 / 100) = 26.04g carbs.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nTotal = 2 + 13 = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal.

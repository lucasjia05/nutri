Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Use total energy (106.6 kcal) to guide assumptions.\n248g of dry oats would contain far more than 900 kcal, so this must refer to a very diluted mixture\u2014either cooked oatmeal or an oat-based drink.\nThis energy density = 106.6 kcal / 248g \u2248 0.43 kcal/g, indicating a highly water-diluted product.\nThis is consistent with an oat drink.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nCooked oatmeal (or a thin oat drink) typically has around 10-12g carbs per 100g.\nUsing a conservative mid-range value of 10.5g/100g:\n248g * 0.105 = 26.04g carbs\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 1470 kcal. For breakfast, I had 61.9g of red palm oil and 729.0g of ready-to-eat maize porridge.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- 61.9g of red palm oil\n- 729g of ready-to-eat maize porridge\nThe total energy content is 1470 kcal.\n2. Use total energy (1470 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nPalm oil has 0g carbohydrates and is almost entirely fat (~9 kcal/g), so:\n61.9g * 9 = 557.1 kcal from fat\nThat leaves 1470 - 557.1 = 912.9 kcal from the porridge.\nEnergy density of the porridge = 912.9 kcal / 729g \u2248 1.25 kcal/g, indicating a thicker porridge (not watery).\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nThicker maize porridges can have 25-30g of carbs per 100g.\nUsing 28.4g/100g as a realistic estimate:\n729g * 0.284 = 207.04g carbs\n4.

Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Use total energy (106.6 kcal) to guide assumptions.\n248g of dry oats would contain far more than 900 kcal, so this must refer to a very diluted mixture\u2014either cooked oatmeal or an oat-based drink.\nThis energy density = 106.6 kcal / 248g \u2248 0.43 kcal/g, indicating a highly water-diluted product.\nThis is consistent with an oat drink.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nCooked oatmeal (or a thin oat drink) typically has around 10-12g carbs per 100g.\nUsing a conservative mid-range value of 10.5g/100g:\n248g * 0.105 = 26.04g carbs\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 1470 kcal.

Use total energy (106.6 kcal) to guide assumptions.\n248g of dry oats would contain far more than 900 kcal, so this must refer to a very diluted mixture\u2014either cooked oatmeal or an oat-based drink.\nThis energy density = 106.6 kcal / 248g \u2248 0.43 kcal/g, indicating a highly water-diluted product.\nThis is consistent with an oat drink.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nCooked oatmeal (or a thin oat drink) typically has around 10-12g carbs per 100g.\nUsing a conservative mid-range value of 10.5g/100g:\n248g * 0.105 = 26.04g carbs\n4.

Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- A drink made from 248g of oatmeal and water\nThe total energy content is 106.6 kcal.\n2. Use total energy (106.6 kcal) to guide assumptions.\n248g of dry oats would contain far more than 900 kcal, so this must refer to a very diluted mixture\u2014either cooked oatmeal or an oat-based drink.\nThis energy density = 106.6 kcal / 248g \u2248 0.43 kcal/g, indicating a highly water-diluted product.\nThis is consistent with an oat drink.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nCooked oatmeal (or a thin oat drink) typically has around 10-12g carbs per 100g.\nUsing a conservative mid-range value of 10.5g/100g:\n248g * 0.105 = 26.04g carbs\n4.

Use total energy (1470 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nPalm oil has 0g carbohydrates and is almost entirely fat (~9 kcal/g), so:\n61.9g * 9 = 557.1 kcal from fat\nThat leaves 1470 - 557.1 = 912.9 kcal from the porridge.\nEnergy density of the porridge = 912.9 kcal / 729g \u2248 1.25 kcal/g, indicating a thicker porridge (not watery).\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nThicker maize porridges can have 25-30g of carbs per 100g.\nUsing 28.4g/100g as a realistic estimate:\n729g * 0.284 = 207.04g carbs\n4.

Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Use total energy (106.6 kcal) to guide assumptions.\n248g of dry oats would contain far more than 900 kcal, so this must refer to a very diluted mixture\u2014either cooked oatmeal or an oat-based drink.\nThis energy density = 106.6 kcal / 248g \u2248 0.43 kcal/g, indicating a highly water-diluted product.\nThis is consistent with an oat drink.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nCooked oatmeal (or a thin oat drink) typically has around 10-12g carbs per 100g.\nUsing a conservative mid-range value of 10.5g/100g:\n248g * 0.105 = 26.04g carbs\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 1470 kcal.

Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Use total energy (1470 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nPalm oil has 0g carbohydrates and is almost entirely fat (~9 kcal/g), so:\n61.9g * 9 = 557.1 kcal from fat\nThat leaves 1470 - 557.1 = 912.9 kcal from the porridge.\nEnergy density of the porridge = 912.9 kcal / 729g \u2248 1.25 kcal/g, indicating a thicker porridge (not watery).\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nThicker maize porridges can have 25-30g of carbs per 100g.\nUsing 28.4g/100g as a realistic estimate:\n729g * 0.284 = 207.04g carbs\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 207.04}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal.

Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood\nThe total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n2. Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nEstimated total carbs = 39 + 3.1 = 42.1 g.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 42.1}\n", "query": "The following meal contains 1114.8 kcal.

Use total energy (1470 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nPalm oil has 0g carbohydrates and is almost entirely fat (~9 kcal/g), so:\n61.9g * 9 = 557.1 kcal from fat\nThat leaves 1470 - 557.1 = 912.9 kcal from the porridge.\nEnergy density of the porridge = 912.9 kcal / 729g \u2248 1.25 kcal/g, indicating a thicker porridge (not watery).\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nThicker maize porridges can have 25-30g of carbs per 100g.\nUsing 28.4g/100g as a realistic estimate:\n729g * 0.284 = 207.04g carbs\n4.

Use total energy (1470 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nPalm oil has 0g carbohydrates and is almost entirely fat (~9 kcal/g), so:\n61.9g * 9 = 557.1 kcal from fat\nThat leaves 1470 - 557.1 = 912.9 kcal from the porridge.\nEnergy density of the porridge = 912.9 kcal / 729g \u2248 1.25 kcal/g, indicating a thicker porridge (not watery).\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nThicker maize porridges can have 25-30g of carbs per 100g.\nUsing 28.4g/100g as a realistic estimate:\n729g * 0.284 = 207.04g carbs\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 207.04}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal.

Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood\nThe total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n2. Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nEstimated total carbs = 39 + 3.1 = 42.1 g.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 42.1}\n", "query": "The following meal contains 782.24 kcal.

Use total energy (1470 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nPalm oil has 0g carbohydrates and is almost entirely fat (~9 kcal/g), so:\n61.9g * 9 = 557.1 kcal from fat\nThat leaves 1470 - 557.1 = 912.9 kcal from the porridge.\nEnergy density of the porridge = 912.9 kcal / 729g \u2248 1.25 kcal/g, indicating a thicker porridge (not watery).\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nThicker maize porridges can have 25-30g of carbs per 100g.\nUsing 28.4g/100g as a realistic estimate:\n729g * 0.284 = 207.04g carbs\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 207.04}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal.

Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Use total energy (1470 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nPalm oil has 0g carbohydrates and is almost entirely fat (~9 kcal/g), so:\n61.9g * 9 = 557.1 kcal from fat\nThat leaves 1470 - 557.1 = 912.9 kcal from the porridge.\nEnergy density of the porridge = 912.9 kcal / 729g \u2248 1.25 kcal/g, indicating a thicker porridge (not watery).\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nThicker maize porridges can have 25-30g of carbs per 100g.\nUsing 28.4g/100g as a realistic estimate:\n729g * 0.284 = 207.04g carbs\n4.

Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Use total energy (106.6 kcal) to guide assumptions.\n248g of dry oats would contain far more than 900 kcal, so this must refer to a very diluted mixture\u2014either cooked oatmeal or an oat-based drink.\nThis energy density = 106.6 kcal / 248g \u2248 0.43 kcal/g, indicating a highly water-diluted product.\nThis is consistent with an oat drink.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nCooked oatmeal (or a thin oat drink) typically has around 10-12g carbs per 100g.\nUsing a conservative mid-range value of 10.5g/100g:\n248g * 0.105 = 26.04g carbs\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 1470 kcal. For breakfast, I had 61.9g of red palm oil and 729.0g of ready-to-eat maize porridge.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- 61.9g of red palm oil\n- 729g of ready-to-eat maize porridge\nThe total energy content is 1470 kcal.\n2. Use total energy (1470 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nPalm oil has 0g carbohydrates and is almost entirely fat (~9 kcal/g), so:\n61.9g * 9 = 557.1 kcal from fat\nThat leaves 1470 - 557.1 = 912.9 kcal from the porridge.\nEnergy density of the porridge = 912.9 kcal / 729g \u2248 1.25 kcal/g, indicating a thicker porridge (not watery).\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nThicker maize porridges can have 25-30g of carbs per 100g.\nUsing 28.4g/100g as a realistic estimate:\n729g * 0.284 = 207.04g carbs\n4.

Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Use total energy (106.6 kcal) to guide assumptions.\n248g of dry oats would contain far more than 900 kcal, so this must refer to a very diluted mixture\u2014either cooked oatmeal or an oat-based drink.\nThis energy density = 106.6 kcal / 248g \u2248 0.43 kcal/g, indicating a highly water-diluted product.\nThis is consistent with an oat drink.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nCooked oatmeal (or a thin oat drink) typically has around 10-12g carbs per 100g.\nUsing a conservative mid-range value of 10.5g/100g:\n248g * 0.105 = 26.04g carbs\n4.

Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nEstimated total carbs = 39 + 3.1 = 42.1 g.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 42.1}\n", "query": "The following meal contains 889.49 kcal.

Use total energy (106.6 kcal) to guide assumptions.\n248g of dry oats would contain far more than 900 kcal, so this must refer to a very diluted mixture\u2014either cooked oatmeal or an oat-based drink.\nThis energy density = 106.6 kcal / 248g \u2248 0.43 kcal/g, indicating a highly water-diluted product.\nThis is consistent with an oat drink.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nCooked oatmeal (or a thin oat drink) typically has around 10-12g carbs per 100g.\nUsing a conservative mid-range value of 10.5g/100g:\n248g * 0.105 = 26.04g carbs\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 1470 kcal.

Use total energy (1470 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nPalm oil has 0g carbohydrates and is almost entirely fat (~9 kcal/g), so:\n61.9g * 9 = 557.1 kcal from fat\nThat leaves 1470 - 557.1 = 912.9 kcal from the porridge.\nEnergy density of the porridge = 912.9 kcal / 729g \u2248 1.25 kcal/g, indicating a thicker porridge (not watery).\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nThicker maize porridges can have 25-30g of carbs per 100g.\nUsing 28.4g/100g as a realistic estimate:\n729g * 0.284 = 207.04g carbs\n4.

Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Use total energy (1470 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nPalm oil has 0g carbohydrates and is almost entirely fat (~9 kcal/g), so:\n61.9g * 9 = 557.1 kcal from fat\nThat leaves 1470 - 557.1 = 912.9 kcal from the porridge.\nEnergy density of the porridge = 912.9 kcal / 729g \u2248 1.25 kcal/g, indicating a thicker porridge (not watery).\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nThicker maize porridges can have 25-30g of carbs per 100g.\nUsing 28.4g/100g as a realistic estimate:\n729g * 0.284 = 207.04g carbs\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 207.04}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal.

Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Use total energy (106.6 kcal) to guide assumptions.\n248g of dry oats would contain far more than 900 kcal, so this must refer to a very diluted mixture\u2014either cooked oatmeal or an oat-based drink.\nThis energy density = 106.6 kcal / 248g \u2248 0.43 kcal/g, indicating a highly water-diluted product.\nThis is consistent with an oat drink.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nCooked oatmeal (or a thin oat drink) typically has around 10-12g carbs per 100g.\nUsing a conservative mid-range value of 10.5g/100g:\n248g * 0.105 = 26.04g carbs\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 1470 kcal.

Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Use total energy (1470 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nPalm oil has 0g carbohydrates and is almost entirely fat (~9 kcal/g), so:\n61.9g * 9 = 557.1 kcal from fat\nThat leaves 1470 - 557.1 = 912.9 kcal from the porridge.\nEnergy density of the porridge = 912.9 kcal / 729g \u2248 1.25 kcal/g, indicating a thicker porridge (not watery).\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nThicker maize porridges can have 25-30g of carbs per 100g.\nUsing 28.4g/100g as a realistic estimate:\n729g * 0.284 = 207.04g carbs\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 207.04}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal.

Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood\nThe total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n2. Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood\nThe total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n2. Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nEstimated total carbs = 39 + 3.1 = 42.1 g.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 42.1}\n", "query": "The following meal contains 61.0 kcal.

Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Use total energy (106.6 kcal) to guide assumptions.\n248g of dry oats would contain far more than 900 kcal, so this must refer to a very diluted mixture\u2014either cooked oatmeal or an oat-based drink.\nThis energy density = 106.6 kcal / 248g \u2248 0.43 kcal/g, indicating a highly water-diluted product.\nThis is consistent with an oat drink.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nCooked oatmeal (or a thin oat drink) typically has around 10-12g carbs per 100g.\nUsing a conservative mid-range value of 10.5g/100g:\n248g * 0.105 = 26.04g carbs\n4.

Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Use total energy (106.6 kcal) to guide assumptions.\n248g of dry oats would contain far more than 900 kcal, so this must refer to a very diluted mixture\u2014either cooked oatmeal or an oat-based drink.\nThis energy density = 106.6 kcal / 248g \u2248 0.43 kcal/g, indicating a highly water-diluted product.\nThis is consistent with an oat drink.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nCooked oatmeal (or a thin oat drink) typically has around 10-12g carbs per 100g.\nUsing a conservative mid-range value of 10.5g/100g:\n248g * 0.105 = 26.04g carbs\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 26.04}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 1470 kcal. For breakfast, I had 61.9g of red palm oil and 729.0g of ready-to-eat maize porridge.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- 61.9g of red palm oil\n- 729g of ready-to-eat maize porridge\nThe total energy content is 1470 kcal.\n2. Use total energy (1470 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nPalm oil has 0g carbohydrates and is almost entirely fat (~9 kcal/g), so:\n61.9g * 9 = 557.1 kcal from fat\nThat leaves 1470 - 557.1 = 912.9 kcal from the porridge.\nEnergy density of the porridge = 912.9 kcal / 729g \u2248 1.25 kcal/g, indicating a thicker porridge (not watery).\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nThicker maize porridges can have 25-30g of carbs per 100g.\nUsing 28.4g/100g as a realistic estimate:\n729g * 0.284 = 207.04g carbs\n4.

Tonight's dinner is 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. Identify each food or beverage item and its serving size.\n- 250 grams of pasta with cream sauce and seafood\nThe total energy content is 383.8 kcal.\n2. Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nEstimated total carbs = 39 + 3.1 = 42.1 g.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 42.1}\n", "query": "The following meal contains 519.0 kcal.

Use total energy (1470 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nPalm oil has 0g carbohydrates and is almost entirely fat (~9 kcal/g), so:\n61.9g * 9 = 557.1 kcal from fat\nThat leaves 1470 - 557.1 = 912.9 kcal from the porridge.\nEnergy density of the porridge = 912.9 kcal / 729g \u2248 1.25 kcal/g, indicating a thicker porridge (not watery).\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nThicker maize porridges can have 25-30g of carbs per 100g.\nUsing 28.4g/100g as a realistic estimate:\n729g * 0.284 = 207.04g carbs\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 207.04}\n\nQuery: \"The following meal contains 383.8 kcal.

Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nEstimated total carbs = 39 + 3.1 = 42.1 g.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 42.1}\n", "query": "The following meal contains 132.0 kcal.

Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nEstimated total carbs = 39 + 3.1 = 42.1 g.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 42.1}\n", "query": "The following meal contains 63.0 kcal.

Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nEstimated total carbs = 39 + 3.1 = 42.1 g.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 42.1}\n", "query": "The following meal contains 1118.0 kcal.

Use total energy (1118.0 kcal) to guide assumptions.\n- Lemon-flavored artificial drink: Typically low in calories, often around 0-10 kcal per 100g, so minimal impact on total kcal.\n- Soft beans: Approximately 110 kcal per 100g, so 113.6g provides about 125 kcal.\n- Wafer cookie: Approximately 130 kcal per 25g.\n- Cooked white rice: Approximately 130 kcal per 100g, so 222g provides about 288.6 kcal.\n- Mixed cereals drink with milk: This is likely the most calorie-dense item. Assuming around 80 kcal per 100g, 267g provides about 213.6 kcal.\n\nAdding these estimates:\n- Lemon-flavored drink: ~0 kcal\n- Soft beans: ~125 kcal\n- Wafer cookie: ~130 kcal\n- Cooked white rice: ~288.6 kcal\n- Mixed cereals drink with milk: ~213.6 kcal\n\nTotal estimated kcal from these items: 757.2 kcal\n\nThe remaining kcal to reach 1118.0 kcal is approximately 360.8 kcal, which suggests the mixed cereals drink with milk is more calorie-dense than initially estimated, likely due to added sugars or higher fat content.\n\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\n- Lemon-flavored artificial drink: Minimal carbs, assume 0g.\n- Soft beans: Approximately 20g carbs per 100g, so 113.6g provides about 22.7g carbs.\n- Wafer cookie: Approximately 18g carbs per 25g.\n- Cooked white rice: Approximately 28g carbs per 100g, so 222g provides about 62.2g carbs.\n- Mixed cereals drink with milk: Assuming a higher carb content due to added sugars, estimate around 15g carbs per 100g, so 267g provides about 40.05g carbs.\n\n4.

Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nEstimated total carbs = 39 + 3.1 = 42.1 g.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 42.1}\n", "query": "The following meal contains 1133.0 kcal.

So, 6.6g * 0.04 = 0.264g carbs.\n- Simmered edible insect larvae: Minimal carbs, approximately 0g.\n- Raw oranges: Moderate in carbs, approximately 12g per 100g. So, 255g * 0.12 = 30.6g carbs.\n- Red palm oil: 0g carbs.\n- Salt: 0g carbs.\n- Beef stock cube: Minimal carbs, approximately 0.5g per 100g. So, 2.6g * 0.005 = 0.013g carbs.\n- Fried ripe red tomatoes: Low in carbs, approximately 4g per 100g. So, 33.2g * 0.04 = 1.328g carbs.\n\n4.

Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4. Add carbohydrate values and respond with total.\nEstimated total carbs = 39 + 3.1 = 42.1 g.\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 42.1}\n", "query": "The following meal contains 794.0 kcal.

Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

Use total energy (383.8 kcal) to guide assumptions.\nWe're given that the total meal weighs 250g and provides 383.8 kcal, so:\nEnergy density = 383.8 kcal / 250g \u2248 1.535 kcal/g\nThis suggests a relatively low-fat, high-water content dish (e.g., light cream sauce, moderate seafood).\nHigh-fat sauces or large seafood portions would push the kcal/g higher (above 2).\nThis energy density is consistent with a moderate portion of pasta, a bit of seafood (low fat), and a modest cream sauce.\n3. Estimate carbohydrate content in grams.\nPasta is the main carbohydrate source here.\nSeafood has minimal carbs. Cream sauce may have some (milk, flour, etc.), but also fat.\nWe'll estimate the dish as follows, based on weight proportions and typical recipes:\nPasta (cooked): ~65% of the weight makes up 250g * 0.65 = 162.5g\nCooked pasta has ~24g carbs per 100g so 162.5g * 0.24 = 39g carbs\nCream sauce: ~25% of the weight makes up 62.5g\nLight cream sauce (mostly cream + milk + flour): ~5g carbs per 100g so 62.5g contains ~3.1g carbs\nSeafood: ~10% of the weight makes up 25g\nMinimal carbs ~0g\n4.

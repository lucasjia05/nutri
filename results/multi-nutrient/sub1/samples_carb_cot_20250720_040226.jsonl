If you don't know the answer, set the value of \"total_carbohydrates\" to -1.\n\nFollow the format of the following examples when answering\n\nQuery: \"This morning, I had a cup of oatmeal with half a sliced banana and a glass of orange juice.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of 1 cup of oatmeal, 1/2 a banana and 1 glass of orange juice.\n1 cup of oatmeal has 27g carbs.\n1 banana has 27g carbs so half a banana has (27*(1/2)) = 13.5g carbs.\n1 glass of orange juice has 26g carbs.\nSo the total grams of carbs in the meal = (27 + 13.5 + 26) = 66.5\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 66.5}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 2g carbs.\n1 toast has 13g carbs.\nSo the total grams of carbs in the meal = (2 + 13) = 15\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 15}\n\nQuery: \"Half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of 1/2 a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.\n1 peanut butter and jelly sandwich has 50.6g carbs so half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich has (50.6*(1/2)) = 25.3g carbs.\nSo the total grams of carbs in the meal = 25.3\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 25.3}", "query": "For breakfast, I have 1g of baking yeast, 24g of boiled kapok flowers, and 63g of millet flour that was dried and boiled with husks. I also added 1g of paprika powder, 2g of iodised salt, 2g of fermented stink beans that were boiled, and 1g of stock cubes.", "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.1, "top_p": 0.1}, "resps": "The meal consists of the following items:\n- 1g of baking yeast\n- 24g of boiled kapok flowers\n- 63g of millet flour (dried and boiled with husks)\n- 1g of paprika powder\n- 2g of iodised salt\n- 2g of fermented stink beans (boiled)\n- 1g of stock cubes\n\nNow, let's calculate the carbohydrates for each item:\n\n1. Baking yeast: 1g of baking yeast has approximately 0.4g of carbs.\n2. Boiled kapok flowers: 24g of boiled kapok flowers have approximately 0.5g of carbs.\n3. Millet flour (dried and boiled with husks): 63g of millet flour has approximately 45g of carbs.\n4. Paprika powder: 1g of paprika powder has approximately 0.5g of carbs.\n5. Iodised salt: 2g of iodised salt has 0g of carbs.\n6. Fermented stink beans (boiled): 2g of fermented stink beans have approximately 0.1g of carbs.\n7. Stock cubes: 1g of stock cubes has approximately 0.2g of carbs.\n\nSo the total grams of carbs in the meal = (0.4 + 0.5 + 45 + 0.5 + 0 + 0.1 + 0.2) = 46.7\n\nOutput: {\"total_carbohydrates\": 46.7}", "pred": 46.7, "threshold": 7.5, "percent": false, "result": {"acc": true, "mae": 2.799999999999997, "mse": 7.839999999999984, "answer_rate": true}}

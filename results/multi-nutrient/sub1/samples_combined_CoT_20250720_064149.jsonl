Chapatti (132.3g):\n   - A standard chapatti (about 40g) has approximately 18g carbohydrates, 3g protein, 3g fat, and 100 kcal.\n   - Assuming the chapatti is made with ghee, the fat content might be slightly higher. Let's estimate 4g fat for a standard chapatti with ghee.\n   - For a 132.3g chapatti, the nutrients would be:\n     - Carbohydrates: (18 * (132.3 / 40)) = 59.535g\n     - Protein: (3 * (132.3 / 40)) = 9.9225g\n     - Fat: (4 * (132.3 / 40)) = 13.23g\n     - Energy: (100 * (132.3 / 40)) = 330.75 kcal\n\n2. Potato curry (42.2g):\n   - A standard serving of potato curry (about 100g) has approximately 15g carbohydrates, 2g protein, 7g fat, and 130 kcal.\n   - For a 42.2g serving, the nutrients would be:\n     - Carbohydrates: (15 * (42.2 / 100)) = 6.33g\n     - Protein: (2 * (42.2 / 100)) = 0.844g\n     - Fat: (7 * (42.2 / 100)) = 2.954g\n     - Energy: (130 * (42.2 / 100)) = 54.86 kcal\n\nSo the total nutrients in the meal are:\n- Total carbohydrates: 59.535 + 6.33 = 65.865g\n- Total protein: 9.9225 + 0.844 = 10.7665g\n- Total fat: 13.23 + 2.954 = 16.184g\n- Total energy: 330.75 + 54.86 = 385.61 kcal\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"total_carbohydrates\": 65.865,\n  \"total_protein\": 10.7665,\n  \"total_fat\": 16.184,\n  \"total_energy\": 385.61\n}\n```"], "pred": {"carb": 65.865, "fat": 16.184, "energy": 385.61, "protein": 10.7665}, "thresholds": {"carb": 7.5, "protein": 2.0, "fat": 2.5, "energy": 50.0}, "percent": false, "result": {"carb": {"acc": false, "mae": 33.53500000000001, "mse": 1124.5962250000007, "answer_rate": true}, "fat": {"acc": false, "mae": 7.284000000000001, "mse": 53.05665600000001, "answer_rate": true}, "energy": {"acc": false, "mae": 191.39, "mse": 36630.132099999995, "answer_rate": true}, "protein": {"acc": false, "mae": 6.733499999999999, "mse": 45.34002224999999, "answer_rate": true}}}

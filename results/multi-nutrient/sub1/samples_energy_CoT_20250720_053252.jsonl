Chamomile tea is typically a low-calorie beverage. A standard serving of chamomile tea (240ml) has about 2 kcal. Since 27g of chamomile tea is not a standard serving size and is likely referring to the dry weight of the tea, we will assume it is negligible in calories for this calculation.\n\n2. 100g of butter cookies have approximately 502 kcal. Therefore, 21g of a butter cookie has (502 * (21/100)) = 105.42 kcal.\n\nSo the total kilocalories in the meal = 105.42 (since the chamomile tea is negligible in calories).\n\nOutput: {\"total_energy\": 105.42}", "pred": 105.42, "threshold": 50.0, "percent": false, "result": {"acc": false, "mae": 91.58, "mse": 8386.8964, "answer_rate": true}}

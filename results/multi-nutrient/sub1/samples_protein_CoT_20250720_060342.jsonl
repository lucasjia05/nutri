Therefore, 3.3g of saut\u00e9ed pork plate flat has (26 * 3.3/100) = 0.858g protein.\n5. Boiled white rice has approximately 2.7g of protein per 100g.

Therefore, 32g of cooked wheat noodles have (5 * 32/100) = 1.6g protein.\n7. Saut\u00e9ed yam bean pods have approximately 1.4g of protein per 100g.

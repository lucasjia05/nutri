Fried bonito: Fried fish typically has about 12g of fat per 100g. Therefore, 12.0 grams of fried bonito has (12 * 12.0 / 100) = 1.44g of fat.\n2. Dry garden peas: Dry peas have about 1.2g of fat per 100g. Therefore, 5.6 grams of dry garden peas has (1.2 * 5.6 / 100) = 0.0672g of fat.\n3. Onions: Onions have about 0.1g of fat per 100g. Therefore, 1.4 grams of onions has (0.1 * 1.4 / 100) = 0.0014g of fat.\n4. Raw polished rice: Raw rice has about 0.3g of fat per 100g. Therefore, 13.1 grams of raw polished rice has (0.3 * 13.1 / 100) = 0.0393g of fat.\n5. Iodized salt: Salt does not contain fat, so 0.1 grams of iodized salt has 0g of fat.\n6. Refined soybean oil: Soybean oil has about 100g of fat per 100g. Therefore, 0.2 grams of refined soybean oil has (100 * 0.2 / 100) = 0.2g of fat.\n7. Unbottled water: Water does not contain fat, so 39.6 grams of unbottled water has 0g of fat.\n8. Garlic: Since the garlic is 0.0 grams, it contributes 0g of fat.\n\nNow, let's sum up the fat content:\n\nTotal fat = 1.44 + 0.0672 + 0.0014 + 0.0393 + 0 + 0.2 + 0 + 0 = 1.7479g\n\nOutput: {\"total_fat\": 1.7479}", "pred": 1.7479, "threshold": 2.5, "percent": false, "result": {"acc": true, "mae": 0.02210000000000001, "mse": 0.0004884100000000004, "answer_rate": true}}

Ripe raw tomato (68.7g): Tomatoes have negligible fat, approximately 0.2g per 100g. Therefore, 68.7g has (0.2 * 68.7 / 100) = 0.1374g of fat.\n7. Vegetable oil (21.0g): Vegetable oil has approximately 100g of fat per 100g. Therefore, 21.0g has (100 * 21.0 / 100) = 21.0g of fat.\n8. Whole maize flour ugali (600g): Whole maize flour has approximately 3.9g of fat per 100g.

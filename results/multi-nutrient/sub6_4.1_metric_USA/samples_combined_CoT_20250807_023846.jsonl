If jelly is 50% less sugar, let's estimate total carbs are about 10% less than standard.\n- Protein: Slightly higher due to reduced fat peanut butter, but not significantly.\n- Fat: 25% less than standard.\n\nCalculations:\n- Standard sandwich (100g): 50.6g carbs, 12.8g protein, 18.6g fat, 404 kcal.\n- For 112g: 50.6*1.12=56.67g carbs, 12.8*1.12=14.34g protein, 18.6*1.12=20.83g fat, 404*1.12=452.48 kcal.\n- Adjust for reduced fat (fat is 75%): 20.83*0.75=15.62g fat.\n- Adjust for reduced sugar (carbs are 90%): 56.67*0.9=51g carbs.\n- Protein remains about the same: 14.34g.\n\nEnergy: Fat reduction and carb reduction both lower calories.  \n- Standard sandwich: 404 kcal per 100g, so 452.48 kcal per 112g.\n- Fat reduction: 5.21g less fat (20.83-15.62), 5.21g*9=46.89 kcal less.\n- Carb reduction: 5.67g less carbs (56.67-51), 5.67g*4=22.68 kcal less.\n- Total kcal reduction: 46.89+22.68=69.57 kcal.\n- Adjusted energy: 452.48-69.57=382.91 kcal.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"total_carbohydrates\": 51,\n  \"total_protein\": 14.34,\n  \"total_fat\": 15.62,\n  \"total_energy\": 382.91\n}"], "pred": {"carb": 51.0, "fat": 15.62, "energy": 382.91, "protein": 14.34}, "thresholds": {"carb": 7.5, "protein": 2.0, "fat": 2.5, "energy": 50.0}, "percent": false, "result": {"carb": {"acc": true, "mae": 2.549999999999997, "mse": 6.502499999999985, "answer_rate": true}, "fat": {"acc": false, "mae": 2.5599999999999987, "mse": 6.553599999999993, "answer_rate": true}, "energy": {"acc": true, "mae": 24.510000000000048, "mse": 600.7401000000024, "answer_rate": true}, "protein": {"acc": true, "mae": 0.40000000000000036, "mse": 0.16000000000000028, "answer_rate": true}}}

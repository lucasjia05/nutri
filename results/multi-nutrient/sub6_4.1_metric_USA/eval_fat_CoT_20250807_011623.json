    "prompt": "For the given query including a meal description, think step by step as follows:\n1. Parse the meal description into discrete food or beverage items along with their serving size. If the serving size of any item in the meal is not specified, assume it is a single standard serving based on common nutritional guidelines (e.g., USDA). Ignore additional information that doesn't relate to the item name and serving size.\n2. For each food or beverage item in the meal, calculate the amount of fat in grams for the specific serving size.\n3. Respond with a dictionary object containing the total fat in grams as follows:\n{\"total_fat\": total grams of fat for the serving}\nFor the total fat, respond with just the numeric amount of fat without extra text. If you don't know the answer, set the value of \"total_fat\" to -1.\n\nFollow the format of the following examples when answering\n\nQuery: \"This morning, I had a cup of oatmeal with half a sliced banana and a glass of orange juice.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of 1 cup of oatmeal, 1/2 a banana and 1 glass of orange juice.\n1 cup of oatmeal has 1.1g fat.\n1 banana has 0.4g fat so half a banana has (0.4*(1/2)) = 0.2g fat.\n1 glass of orange juice has 0.84g fat.\nSo the total grams of fat in the meal = (1.1 + 0.2 + 0.84) = 2.14\nOutput: {\"total_fat\": 2.14}\n\nQuery: \"I ate scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and a toast for breakfast.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of scrambled eggs made with 2 eggs and 1 toast.\nScrambled eggs made with 2 eggs has 16.5g fat.\n1 toast has 0.985g fat.\nSo the total grams of fat in the meal = (16.5 + 1) = 17.5\nOutput: {\"total_fat\": 17.5}\n\nQuery: \"Half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.\"\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe meal consists of 1/2 a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.\n1 peanut butter and jelly sandwich has 18.6g fat so half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich has (18.6*(1/2)) = 9.3g fat.\nSo the total grams of fat in the meal = 9.3\nOutput: {\"total_fat\": 9.3}",
